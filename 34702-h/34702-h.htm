a plural, <span class="grk" title="ta  biblia">&#964;&#8048; &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span>, <i>the</i> (sacred) <i>books</i>&mdash;correctly
expressing the fact that the sacred writings of Christendom (collectively
described by this title) are made up of a number of independent
records, which set before us the successive stages in the history
of revelation. The origin of each of these records forms a
distinct critical problem, and for the discussion of these questions
of detail the reader is referred to the separate articles on the
Biblical books. An account of the Bible as a whole involves so
many aspects of interest, that, apart from the separate articles
on its component books, the general questions of importance
arising out of its present shape require to be discussed in separate
sections of this article. They are here divided accordingly,
into two main divisions:&mdash;(A) Old Testament, and (B) New
Testament; and under each of these are treated (1) the Canon,
(2) the texts and versions, (3) textual criticism, (4) the &ldquo;higher
criticism,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> a general historical account (more particularly
considered for separate books in the articles on them) of the
criticism and views based on the substance and matter, as apart
from criticism devoted to the correction and elucidation of the
text, and (5) chronology. For the literary history of the translated
<i>English Bible</i>, see the separate article under <span class="sc"><a href="#ar2">Bible,

<p class="pt2 center sc">(A) Old Testament</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Canon.</i></p>

<p>We shall begin by giving a general account of the historical
and literary conditions under which the unique literature of the
Old Testament sprang up, of the stages by which it gradually
reached its present form, and (so far as this is possible) of the
way in which the Biblical books were brought together in a
canonical collection. There exists no formal historical account
of the formation of the Old Testament canon. The popular
idea that this canon was closed by Ezra has no foundation in
antiquity. Certainly in the apocryphal book of 2 Esdras,
written towards the end of the 1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, we read (xiv.
20-26, 38-48), that, the law being burnt, Ezra, at his own request,
was miraculously inspired to rewrite it; he procured accordingly
five skilled scribes, and dictated to them for forty days,
during which time they wrote 94 books, <i>i.e.</i> not only (according
to the Jewish reckoning) the 24 books of the Old Testament,
but 70 apocryphal books as well, which, being filled, it is said,
with a superior, or esoteric wisdom, are placed upon even a higher
level (vv. 46, 47) than the Old Testament itself. No argument
is needed to show that this legend is unworthy of credit; even
if it did deserve to be taken seriously, it still contains nothing
respecting either a completion of the canon, or even a collection,
or redaction, of sacred books by Ezra. Yet it is frequently
referred to by patristic writers; and Ezra, on the strength of
it, is regarded by them as the genuine restorer of the lost books
of the Old Testament (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ezra</a></span>).</p>

<p>In 2 Macc. ii. 13 it is said that Nehemiah, &ldquo;founding a library,
gathered together the things concerning the kings and prophets,
and the (writings) of David, and letters of kings about sacred
gifts.&rdquo; These statements are found in a part of 2 Macc. which
is admitted to be both late and full of untrustworthy matter;
still, the passage <i>may</i> preserve an indistinct reminiscence of an
early stage in the formation of the canon, the writings referred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page850" id="page850"></a>850</span>
to being possibly the books of Samuel and Kings and some of the
Prophets, a part of the Psalter, and documents such as those
excerpted in the book of Ezra, respecting edicts issued by
Persian kings in favour of the Temple. But obviously nothing
definite can be built upon a passage of this character.</p>

<p>The first traces of the idea current in modern times that the
canon of the Old Testament was closed by Ezra are found in the
13th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> From this time, as is clearly shown by the
series of quotations in Ryle&rsquo;s <i>Canon of the Old Testament</i>, p. 257 ff.
(2nd ed., p. 269 ff.), the legend&mdash;for it is nothing better&mdash;grew,
until finally, in the hands of Elias Levita (1538), and especially
of Johannes Buxtorf (1665), it assumed the form that the &ldquo;men
of the Great Synagogue,&rdquo;&mdash;a body the real existence of which
is itself very doubtful, but which is affirmed in the Talmud to
have &ldquo;written&rdquo; (!) the books of Ezekiel, the Minor Prophets,
Daniel and Esther&mdash;with Ezra as president, first collected the
books of the Old Testament into a single volume, restored the
text, where necessary, from the best MSS., and divided the
collection into three parts, the Law, the Prophets and the
&ldquo;Writings&rdquo; (the Hagiographa). The reputation of Elias
Levita and Buxtorf led to this view of Ezra&rsquo;s activity being
adopted by other scholars, and so it acquired general currency.
But it rests upon no authority in antiquity whatever.</p>

<p>The statement just quoted, however, that in the Jewish canon
the books of the Old Testament are divided into three parts,
though the arrangement is wrongly referred to Ezra, is in itself
both correct and important. &ldquo;The Law, the Prophets and the
Writings (<i>i.e.</i> the Hagiographa)&rdquo; is the standing Jewish expression
for the Old Testament; and in every ordinary Hebrew
Bible the books are arranged accordingly in the following three
divisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Torah (or &ldquo;Law&rdquo;), corresponding to our &ldquo;Pentateuch&rdquo; (5 books).</p>

<p>2. The &ldquo;Prophets,&rdquo; consisting of eight books, divided into two groups:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The &ldquo;Former Prophets&rdquo;; Joshua, Judges, Samuel; Kings.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The &ldquo;Latter Prophets&rdquo;; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the
         Minor Prophets (called by the Jews &ldquo;the Twelve,&rdquo; and counted
         by them as <i>one</i> book).</p>

<p>3. The &ldquo;Writings,&rdquo; also sometimes the &ldquo;Sacred Writings,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
     as we call them, the &ldquo;Hagiographa,&rdquo; consisting of three
     groups, containing in all eleven books:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The poetical books, Psalms, Proverbs, Job.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The five <i>Megilloth</i> (or &ldquo;Rolls&rdquo;)&mdash;grouped thus together
         in later times, on account of the custom which arose of reading
         them in the synagogues at five sacred seasons&mdash;Song of Songs,
         Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The remaining books, Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah (forming
         <i>one</i> book), Chronicles.</p>

<p>There are thus, according to the Jewish computation,
twenty-four &ldquo;books&rdquo; in the Hebrew canon. The threefold division
of the canon just given is recognized in the Talmud, and followed
in all Hebrew MSS., the only difference being that the books
included in the Latter Prophets and in the Hagiographa are not
always arranged in the same order. No book, however, belonging
to one of these three divisions is ever, by the Jews,
transferred to another. The expansion of the Talmudic twenty-four
to the thirty-nine Old Testament books of the English Bible is
effected by reckoning the Minor Prophets one by one, by
separating Ezra from Nehemiah, and by subdividing the long books
of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles. The different order of the
books in the English Bible is due to the fact that when the
Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek between the 3rd and
1st centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the Hebrew tripartite division was disregarded,
and the books (including those now known as the &ldquo;Apocrypha&rdquo;)
were grouped mostly by subjects, the historical books being
placed first (Genesis&mdash;Esther), the poetical books next
(Job&mdash;Song of Songs), and the prophetical books last (Isaiah&mdash;Malachi).
Substantially the same order was followed in the Vulgate.
The Reformers separated the books which had no Hebrew
original (<i>i.e.</i> the Apocrypha) from the rest, and placed them at
the end; the remaining books, as they stood in the Vulgate, were
then in the order which they still retain in the English Bible.</p>

<p>The tripartite division of the Hebrew canon thus recognized
by Jewish tradition can, however, be traced back far beyond
the Talmud. The Proverbs of Jesus, the son of Sirach (<i>c.</i> 200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
which form now the apocryphal book Ecclesiasticus,
were translated into Greek by the grandson of the author at
about 130 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; and in the preface prefixed by him to his
translation he speaks of &ldquo;the law, and the prophets, and the
other books of our fathers,&rdquo; and again of &ldquo;the law, and the
prophets, and the rest of the books,&rdquo; expressions which point
naturally to the same threefold division which was afterwards
universally recognized by the Jews. The terms used, however,
do not show that the Hagiographa was already completed,
as we now have it; it would be entirely consistent with them,
if, for instance, particular books, as Esther, or Daniel, or
Ecclesiastes, were only added to the collection subsequently. Another
allusion to the tripartite division is also no doubt to be found
in the expression &ldquo;the law, the prophets, and the psalms,&rdquo; in
Luke xxiv. 44. A collection of sacred books, including in particular
the prophets, is also referred to in Dan. ix. 2 (R. V.),
written about 166 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>This threefold division of the Old Testament, it cannot reasonably
be doubted, rests upon an historical basis. It represents
three successive stages in the history of the collection. The Law
was the first part to be definitely recognized as authoritative,
or canonized; the &ldquo;Prophets&rdquo; (as defined above) were next
accepted as canonical; the more miscellaneous collection of
books comprised in the Hagiographa was recognized last. In
the absence of all external evidence respecting the formation
of the canon, we are driven to internal evidence in our endeavour
to fix the dates at which these three collections were thus canonized.
And internal evidence points to the conclusion that the
Law could scarcely have been completed, and accepted formally,
as a whole, as canonical before 444 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (cf. Neh. viii.-x.); that
the &ldquo;Prophets&rdquo; were completed and so recognized about
250 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and the Hagiographa between about 150 and 100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
(See further Ryle&rsquo;s <i>Canon of the Old Testament</i>.)</p>

<p>Having thus fixed approximately the <i>terminus ad quem</i> at
which the Old Testament was completed, we must now begin at
the other end, and endeavour to sketch in outline the process
by which it gradually reached its completed form. And here
it will be found to be characteristic of nearly all the longer
books of the Old Testament, and in some cases even of the
shorter ones as well, that they were not completed by a single
hand, but that they were gradually expanded, and reached their
present form by a succession of stages.</p>

<p>Among the Hebrews, as among many other nations, the earliest
beginnings of literature were in all probability poetical. At
least the opening phrases of the song of Moses in Exodus xv.;
the song of Deborah in Judges v.; the fragment from the &ldquo;Book
of the Wars of Yahweh,&rdquo; in Numbers xxi. 14, 15; the war-ballad,
celebrating an Israelitish victory, in Numbers xxi. 27-30; the
extracts from the &ldquo;Book of Jashar&rdquo; (or &ldquo;of the Upright,&rdquo;
no doubt a title of Israel) quoted in Joshua x. 12, 13 (&ldquo;Sun,
stand thou still upon Gibeon,&rdquo; &amp;c.); in 2 Sam. i. (David&rsquo;s elegy
over Saul and Jonathan); and, very probably, in the Septuagint
of 1 Kings viii. 13 [Sept. 53], as the source of the poetical
fragment in vv. 12, 13, describing Solomon&rsquo;s building of the Temple,
show how great national occurrences and the deeds of ancient
Israelitish heroes stimulated the national genius for poetry,
and evoked lyric songs, suffused with religious feeling, by which
their memory was perpetuated. The poetical descriptions of
the character, or geographical position, of the various tribes,
now grouped together as the Blessings of Jacob (Gen. xlix.)
and Moses (Deut. xxxiii.), may be mentioned at the same time.
These poems, which are older, and in most cases considerably
older, than the narratives in which they are now embedded, if
they were collected into books, must have been fairly numerous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page851" id="page851"></a>851</span>
and we could wish that more examples of them had been
preserved.</p>

<p>The historical books of the Old Testament form two series:
one, consisting of the books from Genesis to 2 Kings (exclusive of
Ruth, which, as we have seen, forms in the Hebrew canon part
of the Hagiographa), embracing the period from the Creation
to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans in 586 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>;
the other, comprising the books of Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah,
beginning with Adam and ending with the second visit of
Nehemiah to Jerusalem in 432 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> These two series differ
from one another materially in scope and point of view, but in
one respect they are both constructed upon a similar plan;
no entire book in either series consists of a single, original work;
but older writings, or sources, have been combined by a compiler&mdash;or
sometimes, in stages, by a succession of compilers&mdash;in
such a manner that the points of juncture are often clearly
discernible, and the sources are in consequence capable of being
separated from one another. The authors of the Hebrew
historical books, as we now have them, do not, as a rule, as a
modern author would do, <i>rewrite</i> the matter in their own language;
they <i>excerpt</i> from pre-existing documents such passages as are
suitable to their purpose, and incorporate them in their work,
sometimes adding at the same time matter of their own. Hebrew
writers, however, exhibit usually such strongly marked individualities
of style that the documents or sources, thus combined, can
generally be distinguished from each other, and from the comments
or other additions of the compiler, without difficulty.
The literary differences are, moreover, often accompanied by
differences of treatment, or representation of the history, which,
where they exist, confirm independently the conclusions of the
literary analysis. Although, however, the historical books
generally are constructed upon similar principles, the method
on which these principles have been applied is not quite the
same in all cases. Sometimes, for instance, the excerpts from
the older documents form long and complete narratives; in
other cases (as in the account of the Flood) they consist of a
number of short passages, taken alternately from two older
narratives, and dovetailed together to make a continuous story;
in the books of Judges and Kings the compiler has fitted together
a series of older narratives in a framework supplied by himself;
the Pentateuch and book of Joshua (which form a literary whole,
and are now often spoken of together as the <i>Hexateuch</i>) have
passed through more stages than the books just mentioned,
and their literary structure is more complex.</p>

<p><i>The Hexateuch</i> (Gen.-Josh.).&mdash;The traditions current among
the Israelites respecting the origins and early history of their
nation&mdash;the patriarchal period, and the times of Moses and
Joshua&mdash;were probably first cast into a written form in the
10th or 9th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by a prophet living in Judah, who,
from the almost exclusive use in his narrative of the sacred name
&ldquo;Jahveh&rdquo; (&ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo;),&mdash;or, as we now commonly write it,
Yahweh,&mdash;is referred to among scholars by the abbreviation
&ldquo;J.&rdquo; This writer, who is characterized by a singularly bright
and picturesque style, and also by deep religious feeling and
insight, begins his narrative with the account of the creation
of man from the dust, and tells of the first sin and its consequences
(Gen. ii. 4<span class="sp">b</span>-iii. 24); then he gives an account of the early growth
of civilization (Gen. iv.), of the Flood (parts of Gen. vi.-viii.),
and the origin of different languages (xi. 1-9); afterwards in a
series of vivid pictures he gives the story, as tradition told it,
of the patriarchs, of Moses and the Exodus, of the journey through
the wilderness, and the conquest of Canaan. It would occupy
too much space to give here a complete list of the passages
belonging to &ldquo;J&rdquo;; but examples of his narrative (with the
exception here and there of a verse or two belonging to one of
the other sources described below) are to be found, for instance,
in Gen. xii., xiii., xviii.-xix. (the visit of the three angels to
Abraham, and the judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah), xxiv.
(Abraham&rsquo;s servant sent to find a wife for Isaac), xxvii. 1-45
(Jacob obtaining his father&rsquo;s blessing), xxxii., xliii., xliv.
(parts of the history of Joseph); Ex. iv.-v. (mostly), viii. 20-ix. 7,
x. 1-11, xxxiii. 12-xxxiv. 26 (including, in xxxiv. 17-26,
a group of regulations, of a simple, undeveloped character, on
various religious observances); Num. x. 29-36, and most of
Num. xi.</p>

<p>Somewhat later than &ldquo;J,&rdquo; another writer, commonly referred
to as &ldquo;E,&rdquo; from his preference for the name <i>Elohim</i> (&ldquo;God&rdquo;)
rather than &ldquo;Jehovah,&rdquo; living apparently in the northern kingdom,
wrote down the traditions of the past as they were current
in northern Israel, in a style resembling generally that of &ldquo;J,&rdquo; but
not quite as bright and vivid, and marked by small differences
of expression and representation. The first traces of &ldquo;E&rdquo; are
found in the life of Abraham, in parts of Gen. xv.; examples
of other passages belonging to this source are:&mdash;Gen. xx. 1-17,
xxi. 8-32, xxii. 1-14, xl.-xlii. and xlv. (except a few isolated
passages); Ex. xviii., xx.-xxiii. (including the decalogue&mdash;in its
original, terser form, without the explanatory additions now
attached to several of the commandments&mdash;and the collection
of laws, known as the &ldquo;Book of the Covenant,&rdquo; in xxi.-xxiii.),
xxxii., xxxiii. 7-11; Num. xii., most of Num. xxii.-xxiv. (the
history of Balaam); Josh. xxiv. &ldquo;E&rdquo; thus covers substantially
the same ground as &ldquo;J,&rdquo; and gives often a parallel, though
somewhat divergent, version of the same events. The laws
contained in Ex. xx. 23-xxiii. 19 were no doubt taken by &ldquo;E&rdquo;
from a pre-existing source; with the regulations referred to
above as incorporated in &ldquo;J&rdquo; (Ex. xxxiv. 17-26), they form
the oldest legislation of the Hebrews that we possess; they
consist principally of <i>civil</i> ordinances, suited to regulate the life
of a community living under simple conditions of society, and
chiefly occupied in agriculture, but partly also of elementary
regulations respecting religious observances (altars, sacrifices,
festivals, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>Not long, probably, after the fall of the northern kingdom
in 722 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, a prophet of Judah conceived the plan of compiling
a comprehensive history of the traditions of his people. For this
purpose he selected extracts from the two narratives, &ldquo;J&rdquo;
and &ldquo;E,&rdquo; and combined them together into a single narrative,
introducing in some places additions of his own. This combined
narrative is commonly known as &ldquo;JE.&rdquo; As distinguished from
the Priestly Narrative (to be mentioned presently), it has a
distinctly <i>prophetical</i> character; it treats the history from the
standpoint of the prophets, and the religious ideas characteristic
of the prophets often find expression in it. Most of the best-known
narratives of the patriarchal and Mosaic ages belong
to &ldquo;JE.&rdquo; His style, especially in the parts belonging to &ldquo;J,&rdquo;
is graphic and picturesque, the descriptions are vivid and abound
in detail and colloquy, and both emotion and religious feeling
are warmly and sympathetically expressed in it.</p>

<p><i>Deuteronomy.</i>&mdash;In the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, during the reign of
either Manasseh or Josiah, the narrative of &ldquo;JE&rdquo; was enlarged
by the addition of the <i>discourses of Deuteronomy</i>. These discourses
purport to be addresses delivered by Moses to the
assembled people, shortly before his death, in the land of Moab,
opposite to Jericho. There was probably some tradition of a
farewell address delivered by Moses, and the writer of Deuteronomy
gave this tradition form and substance. In impressive
and persuasive oratory he sets before Israel, in a form adapted
to the needs of the age in which he lived, the fundamental
principles which Moses had taught. Yahweh was Israel&rsquo;s only
god, who tolerated no other god beside Himself, and who claimed
to be the sole object of the Israelite&rsquo;s reverence. This is the
fundamental thought which is insisted on and developed in
Deuteronomy with great eloquence and power. The truths on
which the writer loves to dwell are the sole godhead of Yahweh,
His spirituality (ch. iv.), His choice of Israel, and the love and
faithfulness which He had shown towards it, by redeeming it
from slavery in Egypt, and planting it in a free and fertile land;
from which are deduced the great practical duties of loyal and
loving devotion to Him, an uncompromising repudiation of all
false gods, the rejection of all heathen practices, a cheerful and
ready obedience to His will, and a warm-hearted and generous
attitude towards man. Love of God is the primary spring of
human duty (vi. 5). In the course of his argument (especially
in chs. xii.-xxvi.), the writer takes up most of the laws, both civil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page852" id="page852"></a>852</span>
and ceremonial, which (see above) had been incorporated before
in &ldquo;J&rdquo; and &ldquo;E,&rdquo; together with many besides which were
current in Israel; these, as a rule, he expands, applies or
enforces with motives; for obedience to them is not to be
rendered merely in deference to external authority, it is to be
prompted by right moral and religious motives. The ideal of
Deuteronomy is a community of which every member is full of
love and reverence towards his God, and of sympathy and
regard for his fellow-men. The &ldquo;Song&rdquo; (Deut. xxxii.) and
&ldquo;Blessing&rdquo; (Deut. xxxiii.) of Moses are not by the author of the
discourses; and the latter, though not Mosaic, is of considerably
earlier date.</p>

<p>The influence of Deuteronomy upon subsequent books of the
Old Testament is very perceptible. Upon its promulgation it
speedily became the book which both gave the religious ideals
of the age, and moulded the phraseology in which these ideals
were expressed. The style of Deuteronomy, when once it had
been formed, lent itself readily to imitation; and thus a school
of writers, imbued with its spirit, and using its expressions,
quickly arose, who have left their mark upon many parts of the
Old Testament. In particular, the parts of the combined
narrative &ldquo;JE,&rdquo; which are now included in the book of Joshua,
passed through the hands of a Deuteronomic editor, who made
considerable additions to them&mdash;chiefly in the form of speeches
placed, for instance, in the mouth of Joshua, or expansions of
the history, all emphasizing principles inculcated in Deuteronomy
and expressed in its characteristic phraseology (<i>e.g.</i> most of
Josh. i., ii. 10-11, iii. 2-4, 6-9, x. 28-43, xi. 10-23, xii., xiii. 2-6,
8-12, xxiii.). From an historical point of view it is characteristic
of these additions that they <i>generalize</i> Joshua&rsquo;s successes, and
represent the conquest of Canaan, effected under his leadership,
as far more complete than the earlier narratives allow us to
suppose was the case. The compilers of Judges and Kings are
also (see below) strongly influenced by Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>The <i>Priestly</i> sections of the Hexateuch (known as &ldquo;P&rdquo;)
remain still to be considered. That these are later than &ldquo;JE,&rdquo;
and even than Deut., is apparent&mdash;to mention but one feature&mdash;from
the more complex ritual and hierarchical organization
which they exhibit. They are to all appearance the work of a
school of priests, who, after the destruction of the Temple in
586 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, began to write down and codify the ceremonial regulations
of the pre-exilic times, combining them with an historical
narrative extending from the Creation to the establishment of
Israel in Canaan; and who completed their work during the
century following the restoration in 537 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The chief object of
these sections is to describe in detail the leading institutions of
the theocracy (Tabernacle, sacrifices, purifications, &amp;c.), and to
refer them to their traditional origin in the Mosaic age. The
history as such is subordinate; and except at important epochs
is given only in brief summaries (<i>e.g</i>. Gen. xix. 29, xli. 46).
Statistical data (lists of names, genealogies, and precise chronological
notes) are a conspicuous feature in it. The legislation
of &ldquo;P,&rdquo; though <i>written down</i> in or after the exile, must not,
however, be supposed to be the <i>creation</i> of that period; many
elements in it can be shown from the older literature to have
been of great antiquity in Israel; it is, in fact, based upon <i>pre-exilic
Temple usage</i>, though in some respects it is a development
of it, and exhibits the form which the older and simpler ceremonial
institutions of Israel ultimately assumed. In &ldquo;P&rsquo;s&rdquo; picture
of the Mosaic age there are many <i>ideal</i> elements; it represents
the priestly ideal of the past rather than the past as it actually
was. The following examples of passages from &ldquo;P&rdquo; will
illustrate what has been said:&mdash;Gen. i. 1-ii. 4<span class="sp">a</span>, xvii. (institution
of circumcision), xxiii. (purchase of the cave of Machpelah),
xxv. 7-17, xlvi. 6-27; Ex. vi. 2-vii. 13, xxv.-xxxi. (directions for
making the Tabernacle, its vessels, dress of the priests, &amp;c.),
xxxv.-xl. (execution of these directions); Lev. (the whole);
Num. i. 1-x. 28 (census of people, arrangement of camp, and
duties of Levites, law of the Nazirite, &amp;c.), xv., xviii., xix.,
xxvi.-xxxi., xxxiii.-xxxvi.; Josh. v. 10-12, the greater part of xv.-xix.
(distribution of the land among the different tribes), xxi. 1-42.
The style of &ldquo;P&rdquo; is strongly marked&mdash;as strongly marked, in
fact, as (in a different way) that of Deuteronomy is; numerous
expressions not found elsewhere in the Hexateuch occur in it
repeatedly. The section Lev. xvii.-xxvi. has a character of its
own; for it consists of a substratum of older laws, partly moral
(chs. xviii.-xx. mostly), partly ceremonial, with a hortatory
conclusion (ch. xxvi.), with certain very marked characteristics
(from one of which it has received the name of the &ldquo;Law of
Holiness&rdquo;), which have been combined with elements belonging
to, or conceived in the spirit of, the main body of &ldquo;P.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not long after &ldquo;P&rdquo; was completed, probably in the 5th century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the whole, consisting of &ldquo;JE&rdquo; and Deuteronomy, was combined
with it; and the existing Hexateuch was thus produced.</p>

<p><i>Judges, Samuel and Kings.</i>&mdash;The structure of these books is
simpler than that of the Hexateuch. The book of Judges
consists substantially of a series of older narratives, arranged
together by a compiler, and provided by him, where he deemed
it necessary, with introductory and concluding comments
(<i>e.g.</i> ii. 11-iii. 6, iii. 12-15<span class="sp">a</span>, 30, iv. 1-3, 23, 24, v. 31<span class="sp">b</span>). The
compiler is strongly imbued with the spirit of Deuteronomy;
and the object of his comments is partly to exhibit the chronology
of the period as he conceived it, partly to state his theory of the
religious history of the time. The compiler will not have written
before <i>c.</i> 600 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; the narratives incorporated by him will in
most cases have been considerably earlier. The books of Samuel
centre round the names of Samuel, Saul and David. They
consist of a series of narratives, or groups of narratives, dealing
with the lives of these three men, arranged by a compiler, who,
however, unlike the compilers of Judges and Kings, rarely
allows his own hand to appear. Some of these narratives are
to all appearance nearly contemporary with the events that they
describe (<i>e.g</i>. 1 Sam. ix. 1-x. 16, xi. 1-11, 15, xiii.-xiv., xxv.-xxxi.;
2 Sam. ix.-xx.); others are later. In 1 Sam. the double
(and discrepant) accounts of the appointment of Saul as king
(ix. 1-x. 16, xi. 1-11, 15, and viii., x. 17-27, xii.), and of the
introduction of David to the history (xvi. 14-23 and xvii. 1-xviii. 5)
are noticeable; in ix. 1-x. 16, xi. 1-11, 15, the monarchy
is viewed as God&rsquo;s gracious gift to His people; in viii., x. 17-27,
xii., which reflect the feeling of a much later date, the monarchy
is viewed unfavourably, and represented as granted by God
unwillingly. The structure of the book of Kings resembles that
of Judges. A number of narratives, evidently written by
prophets, and in many of which also (as those relating to Elijah,
Elisha and Isaiah) prophets play a prominent part, and a series
of short statistical notices, relating to political events, and
derived probably from the official annals of the two kingdoms
(which are usually cited at the end of a king&rsquo;s reign), have been
arranged together, and sometimes expanded at the same time,
in a framework supplied by the compiler. The framework is
generally recognizable without difficulty. It comprises the
chronological details, references to authorities, and judgments
on the character of the various kings, especially as regards their
attitude to the worship at the high places, all cast in the same
literary mould, and marked by the same characteristic phraseology.
Both in point of view and in phraseology the compiler
shows himself to be strongly influenced by Deuteronomy. The
two books appear to have been substantially completed before
the exile; but short passages were probably introduced into
them afterwards. Examples of passages due to the compiler:
1 Kings ii. 3-4, viii. 14-61 (the prayer of dedication put into
Solomon&rsquo;s mouth), ix. 1-9, xi. 32<span class="sp">b</span>-39, xiv. 7-11, 19-20, 21-24,
29-31, xv. 1-15, xxi. 20<span class="sp">b</span>-26; 2 Kings ix. 7-10<span class="sp">a</span>, xvii. 7-23.</p>

<p><i>The Latter Prophets.</i>&mdash;Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the Twelve.
The writings of the canonical prophets form another important
element in the Old Testament, also, like the historical books, of
gradual growth. Beginning with Amos and Hosea, they form
a series which was not completed till more than three centuries
had passed away. The activity of the prophets was largely
called forth by crises in the national history. They were partly
moral reformers, partly religious teachers, partly political
advisers. They held up before a backsliding people the ideals
of human duty, of religious truth and of national policy. They
expanded and developed, and applied to new situations and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page853" id="page853"></a>853</span>
circumstances of the national life, the truths which in a more
germinal form they had inherited from their ancestors. The
nature and attributes of God; His gracious purposes towards
man; the relation of man to God, with the practical consequences
that follow from it; the true nature of religious service;
the call to repentance as the condition of God&rsquo;s favour; the
ideal of character and action which each man should set
before himself; human duty under its various aspects; the
responsibilities of office and position; the claims of mercy and
philanthropy, justice and integrity; indignation against the
oppression of the weak and the unprotected; ideals of a blissful
future, when the troubles of the present will be over, and men
will bask in the enjoyment of righteousness and felicity,&mdash;these,
and such as these, are the themes which are ever in the prophets&rsquo;
mouths, and on which they enlarge with unwearying eloquence
and power.</p>

<p>For the more special characteristics of the individual prophets,
reference must be made to the separate articles devoted to each;
it is impossible to do more here than summarize briefly the
literary structure of their various books.</p>

<p><i>Isaiah.</i>&mdash;The book of Isaiah falls into two clearly distinguished
parts, viz. chs. i.-xxxix., and xl.-lxvi. Chs. xl.-lxvi., however,
are not by Isaiah, but are the work of a prophet who
wrote about 540 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, shortly before the conquest of Babylon
by Cyrus, and whose aim was to encourage the Israelites in
exile, and assure them of the certainty of their approaching
restoration to Canaan. (According to many recent critics, this
prophet wrote only chs. xl.-lv., chs. lvi.-lxvi. being added
subsequently, some time after the return.) The genuine
prophecies of Isaiah are contained in chs. i.-xii., xiv. 24-xxiii.,
xxviii.-xxxiii., xxxvii. 22-32,&mdash;all written between 740 and
700 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (or a little later), and all (except ch. vi.) having reference
to the condition of Judah and Israel, and the movements of the
Assyrians during the reigns of Ahaz and Hezekiah. The opinion
has, however, latterly gained ground that parts even of these
chapters are of later origin than Isaiah&rsquo;s own time. Of the rest of
chs. i.-xxxix. this is generally admitted. Thus chs. xiii. 1-xiv. 23,
xxi. 1-10, xxxiv.-xxxv. belong to the same age as
chs. xl.-lxvi., xiii. 1-xiv. 23, and xxi. 1-10, looking forward
similarly to the approaching fall of Babylon; chs. xxiv.-xxvii.
have a character of their own, and form an apocalypse written
not earlier than the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; chs. xxxvi.-xxxix.,
describing incidents in which Isaiah took a part, consist of
narratives excerpted from 2 Kings xviii. 13-xx. with the addition
of Hezekiah&rsquo;s song (xxxviii. 9-20). It is evident from these
facts that the book of Isaiah did not assume its present form
till considerably after the return of the Jews from exile in 537,
when a compiler, or series of compilers, arranged the genuine
prophecies of Isaiah which had come to his hands, together with
others which at the time were attributed to Isaiah, and gave
the book its present form.</p>

<p><i>Jeremiah.</i>&mdash;Jeremiah&rsquo;s first public appearance as a prophet
was in the 13th year of Josiah (Jer. i. 2, xxv. 3), <i>i.e.</i> 626 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
and his latest prophecy (ch. xliv.) was delivered by him in
Egypt, whither he was carried, against his will, by some of the
Jews who had been left in Judah, shortly after the fall of Jerusalem
in 586. Jeremiah was keenly conscious of his people&rsquo;s
sin; and the aim of most of his earlier prophecies is to bring
his countrymen, if possible, to a better mind, in the hope that
thereby the doom which he sees impending may be averted&mdash;an
end which eventually he saw clearly to be unattainable.
Jeremiah&rsquo;s was a sensitive, tender nature; and he laments, with
great pathos and emotion, his people&rsquo;s sins, the ruin to which
he saw his country hastening, and the trials and persecutions
which his predictions of disaster frequently brought upon him.
A large part of his book is biographical, describing various
incidents of his ministry. Prophecies of restoration are contained
in chs. xxx.-xxxiii. The prophecies of the first twenty-three
years of his ministry, as we are expressly told in ch. xxxvi.,
were first written down in 604 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by his friend and amanuensis
Baruch, and the roll thus formed must have formed the nucleus
of the present book. Some of the reports of Jeremiah&rsquo;s prophecies,
and especially the biographical narratives, also probably
have Baruch for their author. But the chronological disorder of
the book, and other indications, show that Baruch could not
have been the <i>compiler</i> of the book, but that the prophecies
and narratives contained in it were collected together gradually,
and that it reached its present form by a succession of stages,
which were not finally completed till long after Israel&rsquo;s return
from Babylon. The long prophecy (l. 1-li. 58), announcing the
approaching fall of Babylon, is not by Jeremiah, and cannot
have been written till shortly before 538 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p><i>Ezekiel.</i>&mdash;Ezekiel was one of the captives who were carried
with Jehoiachin in 597 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to Babylonia, and was settled with
many other exiles at a place called Tel-abib (iii. 15). His
prophecies (which are regularly dated) are assigned to various
years from 592 to 570 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The theme of the first twenty-four
chapters of his book is the impending fall of Jerusalem, which
took place actually in 586, and which Ezekiel foretells in a series
of prophecies, distinguished by great variety of symbolism
and imagery. Chs. xxv.-xxxii. are on various foreign
nations, Edom, Tyre, Egypt, &amp;c. Prophecies of Israel&rsquo;s future
restoration follow in chs. xxxiii.-xlviii., chs. xl.-xlviii. being
remarkable for the minuteness with which Ezekiel describes
the organization of the restored community, as he would fain
see it realized, including even such details as the measurements
and other arrangements of the Temple, the sacrifices to be offered
in it, the duties and revenues of the priests, and the redistribution
of the country among the twelve tribes. The book of
Ezekiel bears throughout the stamp of a single mind; the
prophecies contained in it are arranged methodically; and to all
appearance&mdash;in striking contrast to the books of Isaiah and
Jeremiah&mdash;it received the form in which we still have it from
the prophet himself.</p>

<p><i>The Twelve Minor Prophets.</i>&mdash;These, as was stated above,
were reckoned by the Jews as forming a single &ldquo;book.&rdquo; The
two earliest of the Minor Prophets, Amos and Hosea, prophesied
in the northern kingdom, at about 760 and 740 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> respectively;
both foresaw the approaching ruin of northern Israel at the
hands of the Assyrians, which took place in fact when Sargon
took Samaria in 722 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; and both did their best to stir their
people to better things. The dates of the other Minor Prophets
(in some cases approximate) are: Micah, <i>c.</i> 725-<i>c.</i> 680 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
(some passages perhaps later); Zephaniah, <i>c.</i> 625; Nahum,
shortly before the destruction of Nineveh by the Manda in 607;
Habakkuk (on the rise and destiny of the Chaldaean empire)
605-600; Obadiah, after the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Chaldaeans in 586; Haggai, 520; Zechariah, i.-viii. (as in
Haggai, promises and encouragements connected with the rebuilding
of the Temple) 520 and 518; Malachi, <i>c.</i> 460-450;
Joel, 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; Jonah, 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The latest
prophecies in the book are, probably, those contained in Zech.
ix.-xiv. which reflect entirely different historical conditions
from Zech. i.-viii. (520 and 518 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and may be plausibly
assigned to the period beginning with the conquests of Alexander
the Great, between 332 and <i>c.</i> 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Why these prophecies
were attached to Zech. i.-viii. must remain matter of conjecture;
but there are reasons for supposing that, together with the
prophecy of Malachi, they came to the compiler of the &ldquo;book&rdquo;
of the Twelve Prophets anonymously, and he simply attached
them at the point which his collection had reached (<i>i.e.</i>
at the end of Zech. viii.).</p>

<p><i>The Psalms.</i>&mdash;The Psalter is that part of the Old Testament
in which the <i>devotional</i> aspect of the religious character finds
its completest expression; and in lyrics of exquisite tenderness
and beauty the most varied emotions are poured forth by the
psalmists to their God&mdash;despondency and distress, penitence
and resignation, hope and confidence, jubilation and thankfulness,
adoration and praise. The Psalter, it is clear from many
indications, is not the work of a single compiler, but was formed
gradually. A single compiler is not likely to have introduced
double recensions of one and the same psalm (as Ps. liii. =
Ps. xiv., Ps. lxx. = Ps. xi. 13-17, Ps. cviii. = Ps. lvii. 7-11 +
lx. 5-12); in the Hebrew canon the Psalter is composed of five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page854" id="page854"></a>854</span>
books (i.-xli., xlii.-lxxii., lxxiii.-lxxxix., xc.-cvi., cvii.-cl.);
and in many parts it is manifestly based upon independent
smaller collections; for it contains groups of psalms headed
&ldquo;David,&rdquo; the &ldquo;sons of Korah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Asaph,&rdquo; &ldquo;Songs of Ascents.&rdquo;
Each of the five books of which it is composed contains psalms
which show that its compilation cannot have been completed
till after the return from the Captivity; and indeed, when the
individual psalms are studied carefully it becomes apparent
that in the great majority of cases they presuppose the historical
conditions, or the religious experiences, of the ages that followed
Jeremiah. Thus, though it is going too far to say that there are
no pre-exilic psalms, the Psalter, as a whole, is the expression
of the deeper spiritual feeling which marked the later stages of
Israel&rsquo;s history. It has been not inaptly termed the Hymn-book
of the second Temple. Its compilation can hardly have been
finally completed before the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; if it is true, as
many scholars think, that there are psalms dating from the time
of the Maccabee struggle (Ps. xliv., lxxiv., lxxix., lxxxiii, and
perhaps others), it cannot have been completed till after 165 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p><i>The Book of Proverbs.</i>&mdash;This is the first of the three books
belonging to the &ldquo;Wisdom-literature&rdquo; of the Hebrews, the
other two books being Job and Ecclesiastes. The Wisdom-literature
of the Hebrews concerned itself with what we should
call the philosophy of human nature, and sometimes also of
physical nature as well; its writers observed human character,
studied action in its consequences, laid down maxims for education
and conduct, and reflected on the moral problems which
human society presents. The book of Proverbs consists essentially
of generalizations on human character and conduct, with
(especially in chs. i.-ix.) moral exhortations addressed to an
imagined &ldquo;son&rdquo; or pupil. The book consists of eight distinct
portions, chs. i.-ix. being introductory, the proverbs, properly
so called, beginning at x. 1 (with the title &ldquo;The Proverbs of
Solomon&rdquo;), and other, shorter collections, beginning at xxii. 17,
xxiv. 23, xxv. 1, xxx. 1, xxxi. 1, xxxi. 10 respectively. The
book, it is evident, was formed gradually. A small nucleus
of the proverbs may be Solomon&rsquo;s; but the great majority
represent no doubt the generalizations of a long succession of
&ldquo;wise men.&rdquo; The introduction, or &ldquo;Praise of Wisdom,&rdquo; as
it has been called (chs. i.-ix), commending the maxims of
Wisdom as a guide to the young, will have been added after
most of the rest of the book was already complete. The book
will not have finally reached its present form before the 4th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Some scholars believe that it dates entirely from
the Greek period (which began 332 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>); but it may be doubted
whether there are sufficient grounds for this conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Job.</i>&mdash;The book of Job deals with a problem of human life;
in modern phraseology it is a work of <i>religious philosophy</i>. Job
is a righteous man, overwhelmed with undeserved misfortune;
and thus the question is raised, Why do the righteous suffer?
Is their suffering consistent with the justice of God? The
dominant theory at the time when Job was written was that all
suffering was a punishment of sin; and the aim of the book is
to controvert this theory. Job&rsquo;s friends argue that he must have
been guilty of some grave sin; Job himself passionately maintains
his innocence; and on the issue thus raised the dialogue
of the book turns. The outline of Job&rsquo;s story was no doubt
supplied by tradition; and a later poet has developed this outline,
and made it a vehicle for expressing his new thoughts
respecting a great moral problem which perplexed his contemporaries.
A variety of indications (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Job</a></span>) combine to show
that the book of Job was not written till after the time of
Jeremiah&mdash;probably, indeed, not till after the return from exile.
The speeches of Elihu (chs. xxxii.-xxxvii.) are not part of the
original poem, but were inserted in it afterwards.</p>

<p>There follow (in the Hebrew Bible) the five short books, which,
as explained above, are now known by the Jews as the <i>Megilloth</i>,
or &ldquo;Rolls,&rdquo; viz. Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes
and Esther. Of these, the <i>Song of Songs</i>, in exquisite poetry,
extols the power and sweetness of pure and faithful human love.
The date at which it was written is uncertain; there are features
in it which point to its having been the work of a poet living
in north Israel, and writing at an early date; but most recent
scholars, on account chiefly of certain late expressions occurring
in it, think that it cannot have been written earlier than the
4th or 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> In the graceful and tender idyll of <i>Ruth</i>,
it is told how Ruth, the Moabitess, and a native consequently
of a country hostile theocratically to Israel, adopted Israel&rsquo;s
faith (i. 16), and was counted worthy to become an ancestress
of David. The date of Ruth is disputed; Driver has defended
a pre-exilic date for it, but the general opinion of modern scholars
is that it belongs to the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The <i>Lamentations</i>
consist of five elegies on the fall of Jerusalem, and the sufferings
which its people experienced in consequence; they must all
have been composed not long after 586 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, the
third book belonging (see above) to the Wisdom-literature,
consists of moralizings, prompted by the dark times in which
the author&rsquo;s lot in life was cast, on the disappointments which
seemed to him to be the reward of all human endeavour, and
the inability of man to remedy the injustices and anomalies of
society. If only upon linguistic grounds&mdash;for the Hebrew of the
book resembles often that of the Mishnah more than the ordinary
Hebrew of the Old Testament&mdash;Ecclesiastes must be one of the
latest books in the Hebrew canon. It was most probably
written during the Greek period towards the end of the 3rd
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The book of <i>Esther</i>, which describes, with many
legendary traits, how the beautiful Jewess succeeded in rescuing
her people from the destruction which Haman had prepared for
them, will not be earlier than the closing years of the 4th century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and is thought by many scholars to be even later.</p>

<p><i>The Book of Daniel.</i>&mdash;The aim of this book is to strengthen
and encourage the pious Jews in their sufferings under the
persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, 168-165 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>  Chs. i.-vi.
consist of narratives, constructed no doubt upon a traditional
basis, of the experiences of Daniel at the Babylonian
court, between 605 and 538 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, with the design of illustrating
how God, in times of trouble, defends and succours His faithful
servants. Chs. vii.-xii. contain a series of visions, purporting
to have been seen by Daniel, and describing, sometimes
(especially in ch. xi.) with considerable minuteness, the course
of events from Alexander the Great, through the two royal lines
of the Ptolemies and the Seleucidae, to Antiochus Epiphanes,
dwelling in particular on the persecuting measures adopted by
Antiochus against the Jews, and promising the tyrant&rsquo;s speedy
fall (see <i>e.g.</i> viii. 9-14, 23-25, xi. 21-45). Internal evidence
shows clearly that the book cannot have been written by Daniel
himself; and that it must in fact be a product of the period in
which its interest culminates, and the circumstances of which
it so accurately reflects, <i>i.e.</i> of 168-165 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p><i>Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah.</i>&mdash;These books form the
second series of historical books referred to above, Ezra and
Nehemiah carrying on the narrative of Chronicles, and forming
its direct sequel. 1 Chr. i.-ix. consists mostly of tribal genealogies,
partly based upon data contained in the older books
(Gen.-Kings), partly including materials found by the compiler
elsewhere. 1 Chr. x.-2 Chr. xxxvi. consists of a series of excerpts
from the books of Samuel and Kings&mdash;sometimes transcribed
without substantial change, at other times materially altered
in the process&mdash;combined with matter, in some cases limited
to a verse or two, in others extending to several chapters,
contributed by the compiler himself, and differing markedly from
the excerpts from the older books both in phraseology and in
point of view. The books of Ezra and Nehemiah are of similar
structure; here the sources excerpted are the Memoirs of Ezra
and Nehemiah, written by themselves in the <i>first</i> person;
viz. Ezra vii. 12-ix. (including the decree of Artaxerxes, vii. 12-26);
Neh. i. 1-vii. 73<span class="sp">a</span>, xii. 31-41, xiii.; and a narrative
written in Aramaic (Ezra iv. 8-vi. 18); Ezra x. and Neh. viii.-x.
also are in all probability based pretty directly upon the Memoirs
of Ezra; the remaining parts of the books are the composition
of the compiler. The additions of the compiler, especially in
the Chronicles, place the old history in a new light; he invests
it with the associations of his own day; and pictures pre-exilic
Judah as already possessing the fully developed ceremonial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page855" id="page855"></a>855</span>
system, under which he lived himself, and as ruled by the ideas
and principles current among his contemporaries. There is much
in his representation of the past which cannot be historical.
For examples of narratives which are his composition see
1 Chr. xv. 1-24, xvi. 4-42, xxii. 2-xxix.; 2 Chr. xiii. 3-22, xiv.
6-xv. 15, xvi. 7-11, xvii., xix. 1-xx. 30, xxvi. 16-20, xxix. 3-xxxi.
21. On account of the interest shown by the compiler
in the ecclesiastical aspects of the history, his work has been not
inaptly called the &ldquo;Ecclesiastical Chronicle of Jerusalem.&rdquo;
From historical allusions in the book of Nehemiah, it may be
inferred that the compiler wrote at about 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>
<div class="author">(S. R. D.)</div>

<p class="pt2 center">2. <i>Texts and Versions.</i></p>

<p><i>Text.</i>&mdash;The form in which the Hebrew text of the Old
Testament is presented to us in all MSS. and printed editions is that
of the Massoretic text, the date of which is usually placed
somewhere between the 6th and 8th centuries of the Christian
era. It is probable that the present text became fixed as early
as the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, but even this earlier date leaves a
long interval between the original autographs of the Old Testament
writers and our present text. Since the fixing of the
Massoretic text the task of preserving and transmitting the
sacred books has been carried out with the greatest care and
fidelity, with the result that the text has undergone practically
no change of any real importance; but before that date, owing
to various causes, it is beyond dispute that a large number of
corruptions were introduced into the Hebrew text. In dealing,
therefore, with the textual criticism of the Old Testament it is
necessary to determine the period at which the text assumed its
present fixed form before considering the means at our disposal for
controlling the text when it was, so to speak, in a less settled
condition.</p>

<p>An examination of the extant MSS. of the Hebrew Old Testament
reveals two facts which at first sight are somewhat remarkable.
The first is that the oldest dated MS., the <i>Codex
Babylonicus Petropolitanus</i>, only goes back to the year
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 916, though it is probable that one or two MSS.
<span class="sidenote">Massoretic text.</span>
belong to the 9th century. The second fact is that all our
Hebrew MSS. represent one and the same text, viz. the Massoretic.
This text was the work of a special gild of trained scholars
called Massoretes (<span title="baalei hamasoreth">&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1514;</span>) or &ldquo;masters of tradition&rdquo;
(<span title="masorah">&#1502;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;</span> or less correctly <span title="masoreth">&#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1514;</span>),<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> whose aim was not only to
preserve and transmit the consonantal text which had been
handed down to them, but also to ensure its proper pronunciation.
To this end they provided the text with a complete system of
vowel points and accents.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Their labours further included the
compilation of a number of notes, to which the term Massorah
is now usually applied. These notes for the most part constitute
a sort of index of the peculiarities of the text, and possess but
little general interest. More important are those passages in
which the Massoretes have definitely adopted a variation from
the consonantal text. In these cases the vowel points attached
to the written word (<i>K&#283;th&#299;bh</i>) belong to the word which is to be
substituted for it, the latter being placed in the margin with the
initial letter of <i>Q&#283;r&#275;</i> (= to be read) prefixed to it. Many even of
these readings merely relate to variations of spelling, pronunciation
or grammatical forms; others substitute a more decent
expression for the coarser phrase of the text, but in some
instances the suggested reading really affects the sense of the
passage. These last are to be regarded either as old textual
variants, or, more probably, as emendations corresponding to
the <i>errata</i> or <i>corrigenda</i> of a modern printed book. They
do not point to any critical editing of the text; for the aim of the
Massoretes was essentially conservative. Their object was not
to create a new text, but rather to ensure the accurate transmission
of the traditional text which they themselves had
received. Their work may be said to culminate in the vocalized
text which resulted from the labours of Rabbi Aaron ben Asher
in the 10th century.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a> But the writings of Jerome in the 4th, and
of Origen in the 3rd century both testify to a Hebrew text
practically identical with that of the Massoretes. Similar
evidence is furnished by the Mishna and the Gemara, the Targums,
and lastly by the Greek version of Aquila,<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a> which dates from the
first half of the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Hence it is hardly doubtful
that the form in which we now possess the Hebrew text was
already fixed by the beginning of the 2nd century. On the
other hand, evidence such as that of the <i>Book of Jubilees</i> shows
that the form of the text still fluctuated considerably as late as
the 1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, so that we are forced to place the fixing of
the text some time between the fall of Jerusalem and the production
of Aquila&rsquo;s version. Nor is the occasion far to seek. After
the fall of Jerusalem the new system of biblical exegesis founded
by Rabbi Hillel reached its climax at Jamnia under the famous
Rabbi Aqiba (d. <i>c.</i> 132). The latter&rsquo;s system of interpretation
was based upon an extremely literal treatment of the text,
according to which the smallest words or particles, and sometimes
even the letters of scripture, were invested with divine
authority. The inevitable result of such a system must have
been the fixing of an officially recognized text, which could
scarcely have differed materially from that which was finally
adopted by the Massoretes. That the standard edition was
not the result of the critical investigation of existing materials
may be assumed with some certainty.<a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Indeed, it is probable,
as has been suggested,<a name="fa7a" id="fa7a" href="#ft7a"><span class="sp">7</span></a> that the manuscript
which was adopted as the standard text was an old and well-written
copy, possibly one of those which were preserved in the Court of the
Temple.</p>

<p>But if the evidence available points to the time of Hadrian as
the period at which the Hebrew text assumed its present form,
it is even more certain that prior to that date the various MSS.
of the Old Testament differed very materially from one another.
Sufficient proof of this statement is furnished by the Samaritan
Pentateuch and the versions, more especially the Septuagint.
Indications also are not wanting in the Hebrew text itself to
show that in earlier times the text was treated with considerable
freedom. Thus, according to Jewish tradition, there are eighteen<a name="fa8a" id="fa8a" href="#ft8a"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
passages in which the older scribes deliberately altered the text
on the ground that the language employed was either irreverent
or liable to misconception. Of a similar nature are the changes
introduced into proper names, <i>e.g.</i> the substitution of <i>bosheth</i>
(= shame) for <i>ba&rsquo;al</i> in Ishbosheth (2 Sam. ii. 8) and Mephibosheth
(2 Sam. ix. 6; cf. the older forms Eshbaal and Meribaal, 1 Chron.
viii. 34, 35); the use of the verb &ldquo;to bless&rdquo; (<span title="bareh">&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;</span>) in the sense
of cursing (1 Kings xxi. 10, 13; Job i. 5, 11, ii. 5, 9; Ps. x. 3);
and the insertion of &ldquo;the enemies of&rdquo; in 1 Sam. xxv. 22, 2 Sam.
xii. 14. These intentional alterations, however, only affect a
very limited portion of the text, and, though it is possible that
other changes were introduced at different times, it is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page856" id="page856"></a>856</span>
unlikely that they were either more extensive in range or more
important in character. At the same time it is clear both from
internal and external evidence that the archetype from which our
MSS. are descended was far from being a perfect representative of
the original text. For a comparison of the different parallel
passages which occur in the Old Testament (<i>e.g.</i> 1 and 2 Samuel,
1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles; 2 Kings xviii. 13-xx. 19
and Isaiah xxxvi.-xxxix; 2 Sam. xxii. and Ps. xviii.; Ps. xiv.
and liii., &amp;c.) reveals many variations which are obviously due to
textual corruption, while there are many passages which in their
present form are either ungrammatical, or inconsistent with the
context or with other passages. Externally also the ancient
versions, especially the Septuagint, frequently exhibit variations
from the Hebrew which are not only intrinsically more probable,
but often explain the difficulties presented by the Massoretic
text. Our estimate of the value of these variant readings,
moreover, is considerably heightened when we consider that the
MSS. on which the versions are based are older by several
centuries than those from which the Massoretic text was derived;
hence the text which they presuppose has no slight claim to be
regarded as an important witness for the original Hebrew.
&ldquo;But the use of the ancient versions&rdquo; (to quote Prof. Driver<a name="fa9a" id="fa9a" href="#ft9a"><span class="sp">9</span></a>)
&ldquo;is not always such a simple matter as might be inferred.... In
the use of the ancient versions for the purposes of textual
criticism there are <i>three</i> precautions which must always be
observed; we must reasonably assure ourselves that we possess
the version itself in its original integrity; we must eliminate
such variants as have the appearance of originating merely with
the translator; the remainder, which will be those that are due
to a difference of text in the MS. (or MSS.) used by the translator,
we must then compare carefully, in the light of the considerations
just stated, with the existing Hebrew text, in order to
determine on which side the superiority lies.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Versions.</i>&mdash;In point of age the Samaritan Pentateuch furnishes
the earliest external witness to the Hebrew text. It is not a version,
but merely that text of the Pentateuch which has been
preserved by the Samaritan community since the time
<span class="sidenote">Samaritan.</span>
of Nehemiah (Neh. xiii. 23-31), <i>i.e.</i> about 432 <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa10a" id="fa10a" href="#ft10a"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
It is written in the Samaritan script, which is closely allied to the
old Hebrew as opposed to the later &ldquo;square&rdquo; character. We further
possess a Samaritan Targum of the Pentateuch written in the
Samaritan dialect, a variety of western Aramaic, and also an Arabic
translation of the five books of the law; the latter dating perhaps
from the 11th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> or earlier. The Samaritan Pentateuch
agrees with the Septuagint version in many passages, but its chief
importance lies in the proof which it affords as to the substantial
agreement of our present text of the Pentateuch, apart from certain
intentional changes,<a name="fa11a" id="fa11a" href="#ft11a"><span class="sp">11</span></a> with that which was promulgated by Ezra.
Its value for critical purposes is considerably discounted by the
late date of the MSS., upon which the printed text is based.</p>

<p>The Targums, or Aramaic paraphrases of the books of the Old
Testament (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Targum</a></span>), date from the time when Hebrew had
become superseded by Aramaic as the language spoken
by the Jews, <i>i.e.</i> during the period immediately preceding
<span class="sidenote">Aramaic.</span>
the Christian era. In their written form, however, the earlier
Targums, viz. those on the Pentateuch and the prophetical books,
cannot be earlier than the 4th or 5th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Since they were
designed to meet the needs of the people and had a directly edificatory
aim, they are naturally characterized by expansion and paraphrase,
and thus afford invaluable illustrations of the methods of
Jewish interpretation and of the development of Jewish thought.
The text which they exhibit is virtually identical with the
Massoretic text.</p>

<p>The earliest among the versions as well as the most important
for the textual criticism of the Old Testament is the Septuagint.
This version probably arose out of the needs of the
Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria in the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Septuagint.</span>
According to tradition the law was translated into Greek
during the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus (284-247 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and,
though the form (viz. the <i>Letter of Aristeas</i>) in which this tradition
has come down to us cannot be regarded as historical, yet it seems
to have preserved correctly both the date and the locality of the
version. The name Septuagint, strictly speaking, only applies to
the translation of the Pentateuch, but it was afterwards extended
to include the other books of the Old Testament as they were
translated. That the interval which elapsed before the Prophets and the
Hagiographa were also translated was no great one is shown by the
prologue to Sirach which speaks of &ldquo;the Law, the Prophets and
the rest of the books,&rdquo; as already current in a translation by 132 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
The date at which the various books were combined into a single
work is not known, but the existence of the Septuagint as a whole
may be assumed for the 1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, at which period the Greek
version was universally accepted by the Jews of the Dispersion
as Scripture, and from them passed on to the Christian Church.</p>

<p>The position of the Septuagint, however, as the official Greek
representative of the Old Testament did not long remain unchallenged.
The opposition, as might be expected, came
from the side of the Jews, and was due partly to the
<span class="sidenote">Versions of Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion.</span>
controversial use which was made of the version by the
Christians, but chiefly to the fact that it was not sufficiently
in agreement with the standard Hebrew text established
by Rabbi Aqiba and his school. Hence arose in
the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> the three new versions of Aquila,
Symmachus and Theodotion. Aquila was a Jewish proselyte of
Pontus, and since he was a disciple of Rabbi Aqiba (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 135), and
(according to another Talmudic account) also of Rabbi Eliezer and
Rabbi Joshua, the immediate predecessors of Aqiba, his version may
be assigned to the first half of the 2nd century. It is characterized
by extreme literalness, and clearly reflects the peculiar system of
exegesis which was then in vogue among the Jewish rabbis. Its
slavish adherence to the original caused the new translation to be
received with favour by the Hellenistic Jews, among whom it quickly
superseded the older Septuagint. For what remains of this version,
which owing to its character is of the greatest value to the textual
critic, we have until recently been indebted to Origen&rsquo;s <i>Hexapla</i>
(see below); for, though Jerome mentions a <i>secunda editio</i>, no MS.
of Aquila&rsquo;s translation has survived. Fragments<a name="fa12a" id="fa12a" href="#ft12a"><span class="sp">12</span></a>, however, of two
codices were discovered (1897) in the genizah at Cairo, which
illustrate more fully the peculiar features of this version.</p>

<p>The accounts given of Theodotion are somewhat conflicting.
Both Irenaeus and Epiphanius describe him as a Jewish proselyte,
but while the former calls him an Ephesian and mentions his translation
before that of Aquila, the latter states that he was a native
of Pontus and a follower of Marcion, and further assigns his work
to the reign of Commodus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 180-192); others, according to
Jerome, describe him as an Ebionite. On the whole it is probable
that Irenaeus has preserved the most trustworthy account.<a name="fa13a" id="fa13a" href="#ft13a"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
Theodotion&rsquo;s version differs from those of Aquila and Symmachus in that
it was not an independent translation, but rather a revision of the
Septuagint on the basis of the current Hebrew text. He retained,
however, those passages of which there was no Hebrew equivalent,
and added translations of the Hebrew where the latter was not
represented in the Septuagint. A peculiar feature of his translation
is his excessive use of transliteration, but, apart from this, his work
has many points of contact with the Septuagint, which it closely
resembles in style; hence it is not surprising to find that later MSS.
of the Septuagint have been largely influenced by Theodotion&rsquo;s
translation. In the case of the book of Daniel, as we learn from
Jerome (<i>praefatio in Dan.</i>), the translation of Theodotion was
definitely adopted by the Church, and is accordingly found in the
place of the original Septuagint in all MSS. and editions.<a name="fa14a" id="fa14a" href="#ft14a"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
It is interesting to note in this connexion that renderings which agree
in the most remarkable manner with Theodotion&rsquo;s version of Daniel
are found not only in writers of the 2nd century but also in the
New Testament. The most probable explanation of this phenomenon
is that these renderings are derived from an early Greek translation,
differing from the Septuagint proper, but closely allied to that
which Theodotion used as the basis of his revision.</p>

<p>Symmachus, according to Eusebius and Jerome, was an Ebionite;
Epiphanius represents him (very improbably) as a Samaritan who
became a Jewish proselyte. He is not mentioned by Irenaeus and
his date is uncertain, but probably his work is to be assigned to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page857" id="page857"></a>857</span>
end of the 2nd century. His version was commended by Jerome as
giving the sense of the original, and in that respect it forms a direct
contrast with that of Aquila. Indeed Dr Swete<a name="fa15a" id="fa15a" href="#ft15a"><span class="sp">15</span></a> thinks it probable
that &ldquo;he wrote with Aquila&rsquo;s version before him, (and that) in his
efforts to recast it he made free use both of the Septuagint and of
Theodotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As in the case of Aquila, our knowledge of the works of Theodotion
and Symmachus is practically limited to the fragments that have
been preserved through the labours of Origen. This writer
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Origen</a></span>) conceived the idea of collecting all the
<span class="sidenote">Origen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hexapla.&rsquo;</span>
existing Greek versions of the Old Testament with a view
to recovering the original text of the Septuagint, partly by their aid
and partly by means of the current Hebrew text. He accordingly
arranged the texts to be compared in six<a name="fa16a" id="fa16a" href="#ft16a"><span class="sp">16</span></a> parallel columns in the
following order:&mdash;(1) the Hebrew text; (2) the Hebrew transliterated
into Greek letters; (3) Aquila; (4) Symmachus; (5) the Septuagint;
and (6) Theodotion. In the Septuagint column he drew attention
to those passages for which there was no Hebrew equivalent by
prefixing an obelus; but where the Septuagint had nothing corresponding
to the Hebrew text he supplied the omissions, chiefly but
not entirely from the translation of Theodotion, placing an asterisk
at the beginning of the interpolation; the close of the passage to
which the obelus or the asterisk was prefixed was denoted by the
metobelus. That Origen did not succeed in his object of recovering
the original Septuagint is due to the fact that he started with the
false conception that the original text of the Septuagint must be
that which coincided most nearly with the current Hebrew text.
Indeed, the result of his monumental labours has been to impede
rather than to promote the restoration of the genuine Septuagint.
For the Hexaplar text which he thus produced not only effaced
many of the most characteristic features of the old version, but also
exercised a prejudicial influence on the MSS. of that version.</p>

<p>The <i>Hexapla</i> as a whole was far too large to be copied, but the
revised Septuagint text was published separately by Eusebius and
Pamphilus, and was extensively used in Palestine during
the 4th century. During the same period two other
<span class="sidenote">Hesychius, Lucian.</span>
recensions made their appearance, that of Hesychius
which was current in Egypt, and that of Lucian which became the
accepted text of the Antiochene Church. Of Hesychius little is
known. Traces of his revision are to be found in the Egyptian
MSS., especially the Codex Marchalianus, and in the quotations of
Cyril of Alexandria. Lucian was a priest of Antioch who was
martyred at Nicomedia in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 311 or 312. His revision (to quote
Dr Swete) &ldquo;was doubtless an attempt to revise the <span class="grk" title="koinae">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#942;</span> (or
&rsquo;common text&rsquo; of the Septuagint) in accordance with the principles
of criticism which were accepted at Antioch.&rdquo; To Ceriani
is due the discovery that the text preserved by codices 19, 82, 93,
108, really represents Lucian&rsquo;s recension; the same conclusion was
reached independently by Lagarde, who combined codex 118 with
the four mentioned above.<a name="fa17a" id="fa17a" href="#ft17a"><span class="sp">17</span></a> As Field (<i>Hexapla</i>, p. 87) has shown,
this discovery is confirmed by the marginal readings of the <i>Syro-Hexapla</i>.
The recension (see Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text of the Books of
Samuel</i>, p. 52) is characterized by the substitution of
synonyms for the words originally used by the Septuagint, and by
the frequent occurrence of double renderings, but its chief claim
to critical importance rests on the fact that &ldquo;it embodies renderings
not found in other MSS. of the Septuagint which presuppose a
Hebrew original self-evidently superior in the passages concerned
to the existing Massoretic text.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Latin Versions.</i>&mdash;Of even greater importance in this respect is
the Old Latin version, which undoubtedly represents a Greek
original prior to the <i>Hexapla</i>. &ldquo;The earliest form of the version&rdquo;
(to quote Dr Kennedy<a name="fa18a" id="fa18a" href="#ft18a"><span class="sp">18</span></a>) &ldquo;to which we can assign a definite date,
namely, that used by Cyprian, plainly circulated in Africa.&rdquo;
In the view of many authorities this version was first produced at
Carthage, but recent writers are inclined to regard Antioch as its
birthplace, a view which is supported by the remarkable agreement
of its readings with the Lucianic recension and with the early Syriac
MSS. Unfortunately the version is only extant in a fragmentary
form, being preserved partly in MSS., partly in quotations of the
<span class="sidenote">Vulgate.</span>
Fathers. The non-canonical books of the Vulgate, however,
which do not appear to have been revised by Jerome,
still represent the older version. It was not until after the 6th
century that the Old Latin was finally superseded by the Vulgate
or Latin translation of the Old Testament made by Jerome during
the last quarter of the 4th century. This new version was translated
from the Hebrew, but Jerome also made use of the Greek versions,
more especially of Symmachus. His original intention was to revise
the Old Latin, and his two revisions of the Psalter, the Roman and
the Gallican, the latter modelled on the <i>Hexapla</i>, still survive.
Of the other books which he revised according to the Hexaplar text,
that of Job has alone come down to us. For textual purposes the
Vulgate possesses but little value, since it presupposes a Hebrew
original practically identical with the text stereotyped by the
Massoretes.</p>

<p><i>Syriac Versions.</i>&mdash;The Peshito (P&rsquo;shitta) or &ldquo;simple&rdquo; revision of
the Old Testament is a translation from the Hebrew, though certain
books appear to have been influenced by the Septuagint. Its date
is unknown, but it is usually assigned to the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Its
value for textual purposes is not great, partly because the underlying
text is the same as the Massoretic, partly because the Syriac
text has at different times been harmonized with that of the
Septuagint.</p>

<p>The Syro-Hexaplar version, on the other hand, is extremely
valuable for critical purposes. This Syriac translation of the
Septuagint column of the <i>Hexapla</i> was made by Paul, bishop of
Tella, at Alexandria in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 616-617. Its value consists
<span class="sidenote">Syro-Hexaplar.</span>
in the extreme literalness of the translation, which renders
it possible to recover the Greek original with considerable certainty.
It has further preserved the critical signs employed by Origen as
well as many readings from the other Greek versions; hence it forms
our chief authority for reconstructing the <i>Hexapla</i>. The greater
part of this work is still extant; the poetical and prophetical books
have been preserved in the <i>Codex Ambrosianus</i> at Milan (published
in photolithography by Ceriani, <i>Mon. Sacr. et Prof.</i>), and the
remaining portions of the other books have been collected by Lagarde in
his <i>Bibliothecae Syriacae</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of the remaining versions of the Old Testament the most
important are the Egyptian, Ethiopic, Arabic, Gothic and Armenian,
all of which, except a part of the Arabic, appear to have been made
through the medium of the Septuagint.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">3. <i>Textual Criticism.</i></p>

<p>The aim of scientific Old Testament criticism is to obtain,
through discrimination between truth and error, a full appreciation
of the literature which constitutes the Old Testament,
of the life out of which it grew, and the secret of
<span class="sidenote">Distinction between Textual and Higher Criticism.</span>
the influence which these have exerted and still exert.
For such an appreciation many things are needed; and
the branches of Old Testament criticism are correspondingly
numerous. It is necessary in the first
instance to detect the errors which have crept into the
text in the course of its transmission, and to recover, so far as
possible, the text in its original form; this is the task of <i>Textual</i>,
or as it is sometimes called in contradistinction to another branch,
<i>Lower Criticism</i>. It then becomes the task of critical exegesis
to interpret the text thus recovered so as to bring out the meaning
intended by the original authors. This <i>Higher Criticism</i> partakes
of two characters, literary and historical. One branch seeks to
determine the scope, purpose and character of the various books
of the Old Testament, the times in and conditions under which
they were written, whether they are severally the work of a
single author or of several, whether they embody earlier sources
and, if so, the character of these, and the conditions under which
they have reached us, whether altered and, if altered, how; this
is <i>Literary Criticism</i>. A further task is to estimate the value of
this literature as evidence for the history of Israel, to determine,
as far as possible, whether such parts of the literature as are
contemporary with the time described present correct, or whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page858" id="page858"></a>858</span>
in any respect one-sided or biased or otherwise incorrect,
descriptions; and again, how far the literature that relates the
story of long past periods has drawn upon trustworthy records,
and how far it is possible to extract historical truth from traditions
(such as those of the Pentateuch) that present, owing to the
gradual accretions and modifications of intervening generations,
a composite picture of the period described, or from a work such
as Chronicles, which narrates the past under the influence of the
conception that the institutions and ideas of the present must
have been established and current in the past; all this falls under
<i>Historical Criticism</i>, which, on its constructive side, must avail
itself of all available and well-sifted evidence, whether derived
from the Old Testament or elsewhere, for its presentation of the
history of Israel&mdash;its ultimate purpose. Finally, by comparing
the results of this criticism as a whole, we have to determine, by
observing its growth and comparing it with others, the essential
character of the religion of Israel.</p>

<p>In brief, then, the criticism of the Old Testament seeks to
discover what the words written actually meant to the writers,
what the events in Hebrew history actually were, what the
religion actually was; and hence its aim differs from the dogmatic
or homiletic treatments of the Old Testament, which have
sought to discover in Scripture a given body of dogma or incentives
to a particular type of life or the like.</p>

<p>Biblical criticism, and in some respects more especially Old
Testament criticism, is, in all its branches, very largely of modern
growth. This has been due in part to the removal of conditions
unfavourable to the critical study of the evidence that existed,
in part to the discovery in recent times of fresh evidence. The
unfavourable conditions and the critical efforts which were made
in spite of them can only be briefly indicated.</p>

<p>For a long time Biblical study lacked the first essential of sound
critical method, viz. a critical text of the literature. Jewish
study was exclusively based on the official Hebrew
text, which was fixed, probably in the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>,
<span class="sidenote">Growth of criticism.</span>
and thereafter scrupulously preserved. This text,
however, had suffered certain now obvious corruptions, and,
probably enough, more corruption than can now, or perhaps ever
will be, detected with certainty. The position of Christian (and
Jewish Alexandrian) scholars was considerably worse; for,
with rare exceptions, down to the 5th century, and practically
without exception between the 5th and 15th centuries, their
study was exclusively based on <i>translations</i>. Beneath the
ancient Greek version, the Septuagint, there certainly underlay an
earlier form of the Hebrew text than that perpetuated by Jewish
tradition, and if Christian scholars could have worked through
the version to the underlying Hebrew text, they would often
have come nearer to the original meaning than their Jewish
contemporaries. But this they could not do; and since the
version, owing to the limitations of the translators, departs widely
from the sense of the original, Christian scholars were on the
whole kept much farther from the original meaning than their
Jewish contemporaries, who used the Hebrew text; and later,
after Jewish grammatical and philological study had been
stimulated by intercourse with the Arabs, the relative disadvantages
under which Christian scholarship laboured increased.
Still there are not lacking in the early centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span> important, if
limited and imperfect, efforts in textual criticism. Origen, in his
<i>Hexapla</i>, placed side by side the Hebrew text, the Septuagint, and
certain later Greek versions, and drew attention to the variations:
he thus brought together for comparison, an indispensable
preliminary to criticism, the chief existing evidence to the text of
the Old Testament. Unfortunately this great work proved too
voluminous to be preserved entire; and in the form in which it
was fragmentarily preserved, it even largely enhanced the critical
task of later centuries. Jerome, perceiving the unsatisfactory
position of Latin-speaking Christian scholars who studied the Old
Testament at a <i>double remove</i> from the original&mdash;in Latin versions
of the Greek&mdash;made a fresh Latin translation direct from the
Hebrew text then received among the Jews. It is only in accordance
with what constantly recurs in the history of Biblical
criticism that this effort to approximate to the truth met at first
with considerable opposition, and was for a time regarded even by
Augustine as dangerous. Subsequently, however, this version of
Jerome (the Vulgate) became the basis of Western Biblical
scholarship. Henceforward the Western Church suffered both
from the corruptions in the official Hebrew text and also from the
fact that it worked from a version and not from the original, for a
knowledge of Hebrew was rare indeed among Christian scholars
between the time of Jerome and the 16th century.</p>

<p>But if the use of versions, or of an uncritical text of the
original, was one condition unfavourable to criticism, another
that was not less serious was the dominance over both Jews and
Christians of unsound methods of interpretation&mdash;legal or
dogmatic or allegorical. The influence of these can be traced as
early as the Greek version (3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and later); allegorical
interpretation is conspicuous in the Alexandrian Jewish
scholar Philo (<i>q.v.</i>); it may be seen in many New Testament
interpretations of the Old Testament (<i>e.g.</i> Gal. iii. 16, iv. 21-31),
found a classical exponent in Origen, and, in spite of the opposition
of the school of Antioch, pre-eminently of Theodore (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 428),
maintained its power virtually unbroken down to the
Reformation. It is true that even by the most thorough-going
allegorists the literal sense of Scripture was not openly and
entirely disregarded; but the very fact that the study of Hebrew
was never more than exceptional, and so early ceased to be
cultivated at all, is eloquent of indifference to the original literal
sense, and the very principle of the many meanings inherent in
the sacred writings was hostile to sound interpretation; greater
importance was attached to the &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; or &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; senses,
<i>i.e.</i> to the various unreal interpretations, and when the literal
sense conflicted with the dogmas or tradition of the Church its
validity was wholly denied. The extraordinary ambiguity and
uncertainty which allegorical interpretation tacitly ascribed to
Scripture, and the ease with which heretical as well as orthodox
teaching could be represented as &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; under the literal
sense, was early perceived, but instead of this leading to any real
check on even wild subjectivity in interpretation and insistence
on reaching the literal sense, it created an ominous principle that
maintained much of its influence long after the supremacy of
allegorism was overthrown. This is the principle that all
interpretation of Scripture must be according to the <i>Regula
fidei</i>&mdash;that all interpretation which makes Scripture contradict or
offend the traditions of the Church is wrong.</p>

<p>The spirit and the age of humanism and the Reformation
effected and witnessed important developments in the study of
the Old Testament. It was still long before any considerable
results were achieved; but in various ways the dogmatic and
traditional treatment of Scripture was undermined; the way
was opened for a more real and historical method. It must
suffice to refer briefly to two points.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. Ignorance gave place to knowledge of the languages in which
the Old Testament was written. In 1506 the distinguished humanist,
Johann Reuchlin, who had begun the study of Hebrew under a
Jewish teacher about 1492, published a work entitled <i>De Rudimentis
Hebraicis</i> containing a Hebrew lexicon and a Hebrew grammar.
In 1504 Konrad Pellikan (Pellicanus), whose study of Hebrew had
profited from intercourse with Reuchlin, had published a brief
introduction to the language. In 1514 the Complutensian Polyglott
began to be printed and in 1522 was published. Various Jewish
editions of the Hebrew Bible had already been printed&mdash;in part
since 1477, entire since 1488; but this work contained the first
Christian edition of the text. Certainly the editors did not intend
hereby to exalt the original above the versions; for they placed the
Vulgate in the centre of the page with the Hebrew on one side,
the Greek on the other, <i>i.e.</i> as they themselves explained it, the
Roman Church between the synagogue and the Greek Church, as
Christ crucified between two thieves. Yet even so the publication
of the Hebrew text by Christian scholars marks an important stage;
henceforth the study of the original enters increasingly into Christian
Biblical schojarship; it already underlay the translations which
form so striking a feature of the 16th century. Luther&rsquo;s German
version (Pentateuch, 1523) and Tyndale&rsquo;s English version (Pentateuch,
1530) were both made from the Hebrew. At first, and indeed
down to the middle of the 17th century, Jewish traditions and
methods in the study of Hebrew dominated Christian scholars;
but in the 17th and 18th centuries the study of other Semitic
languages opened up that comparative linguistic study which was
systematized and brought nearer to perfection in the 19th century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page859" id="page859"></a>859</span>
(which also witnessed the opening up of the new study of Assyrian)
by scholars such as Gesenius, Ewald, Olshausen, Renan, Nöldeke,
Stade and Driver. This has done much to render possible a more
critical interpretation of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>2. An increasing stress was laid on the <i>literal</i> sense of Scripture.
The leading Reformers&mdash;Luther, Zwingli, Melancthon&mdash;frequently
expressed themselves against the prevailing view of the manifold
sense of Scripture, and in particular questioned the legitimacy of
allegorical interpretation&mdash;except for purposes of popular and
practical exposition. The effort to get at and abide by the literal
sense is characteristic of Calvin&rsquo;s extensive exegetical works. True,
practice did not always keep pace with theory, and the literal sense
had to yield if it came into conflict with the &ldquo;Faith&rdquo;: the
allegorical method for long obscured the meaning of the <i>Song of Songs</i>,
and any departure from it was severely condemned; just as Theodore
of Mopsuestia drew down on himself for maintaining the literal
sense of the <i>Song</i> the condemnation of the Second Council of
Constantinople (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 553), so Sebastian Castellio owed (in part) to the
same indiscretion his expulsion from Geneva in 1544. Even in the
16th and 17th centuries scholars like Grotius and Michaelis met with
violent opposition for the same cause.</p>

<p>But, however slowly and irregularly, the new conditions and the
new spirit affected the study of the Old Testament. It became subject
to the same critical methods which since the Renaissance have been
applied to other ancient literatures. Biblical criticism is part of a
wider critical movement, but it is noticeable how, from stage to
stage, Biblical scholars adopted the various critical methods which
as applied to other literatures have been proved valid, rather than
themselves initiated them. The textual criticism of the classical
literatures made way before the textual criticism of the Old
Testament: Bentley&rsquo;s <i>Phalaris</i> (1699) preceded any thorough or
systematic application of Higher Criticism to any part of the Old
Testament; Niebuhr&rsquo;s <i>History of Rome</i> (1811) preceded Ewald&rsquo;s
<i>History of Israel</i> (1843-1859).</p>
</div>

<p>The fundamental principles of the Textual Criticism of the
Old Testament are the same as those which apply to any other
ancient text and need not be described here (see the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Textual Criticism</a></span>). There are also, however,
<span class="sidenote">Conditions of Textual Criticism in the Bible.</span>
certain conditions peculiar to the text of the Old
Testament. The significance of these and the extent
to which they must govern the application of the general
principles have even yet scarcely obtained full and general
recognition. These, then, must be briefly described.</p>

<p>The earliest Hebrew MSS. of the Old Testament date from
not earlier than the 9th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, or nearly one thousand
years after the latest parts of the Old Testament were written.
These MSS., and the Hebrew Bibles as usually printed, contain
in reality two perfectly distinct texts&mdash;the work of two different
ages separated from one another by centuries: the one is a
text of the Old Testament itself, the other a text of a later Jewish
interpretation of the Old Testament. The text of the Old
Testament consists of consonants only, for the alphabet of the
ancient Hebrews, like that of their Moabite, Aramaean and
Phoenician neighbours, contained no vowels; the text of the
interpretation consists of vowels and accents only&mdash;for vowel
signs and accents had been invented by Jewish scholars between
the 5th and 9th centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span>; the text of the Old Testament
is complete in itself and intelligible, though ambiguous; but
the text of the interpretation read by itself is unintelligible, and
only becomes intelligible when read with the consonants (under,
over, or in which they are inserted) of the text of the Old
Testament. But the fact that the later text makes use of the earlier
to make itself intelligible in no way destroys the fact that it is
as entirely distinct a work from the earlier as is any commentary
distinct from the work on which it comments. The first task
of Old Testament textual criticism after the Reformation was
to prove the independence of these two texts, to gain general
recognition of the fact that vowels and accents formed no part
of the original Hebrew text of the Old Testament. The conflict
that arose over this question in the Christian Church was
prolonged and bitter&mdash;in part because it unfortunately became
inflamed by the contending interests of Roman Catholic and
Protestant. The coeval origin of consonants and vowels had
indeed been questioned or denied by the earliest reformers
(Luther, Zwingli, Calvin), but later, in the period of Protestant
scholasticism and under the influence of one school of Jewish
Rabbis, Protestant scholars in particular, and especially those
of the Swiss school, notably the Buxtorfs, had committed
themselves to the view that the vowels formed an integral and
original part of the text of the Old Testament; and this they
maintained with all the more fervency because the ambiguity
of the consonants without the vowels was a troublesome fact
in the way of the extreme Protestant doctrine of the inspiration,
verbal infallibility and sufficiency of Scripture, while it was
by no means unwelcome to Catholic theologians with their
doctrine of the need for an authoritative interpretation. Still
in the end it was due in large measure to the learning and
argumentative power devoted to this subject by the French Protestant
scholar, Louis Capell, and, amongst others, by the English
Protestant scholar, Brian Walton, that by the end of the 17th
century this particular controversy was practically at an end;
criticism had triumphed, and the later origin of the vowels was
admitted. Yet, as often happens, the influence of tradition
lingered long after it had been proved to be false; thus the
R.V., instead of being an independent translation of the Hebrew
text, is intended (with rare exceptions, as <i>e.g.</i> in Is. lix. 19, where
R.V. translates the Hebrew text and R.V. margin the Jewish
interpretation) to be merely a translation of the Jewish
interpretation; and to the present day it is usual, though obviously
uncritical and wrong, to describe perfectly legitimate translations
of the received consonantal text, if they happen to presuppose
other vowels than those provided by Jewish tradition, as
based on emendation; even in the English edition of Haupt&rsquo;s
<i>Sacred Books of the Old Testament</i> (see below) the
possibility of this unfortunate misunderstanding is not altogether
removed.</p>

<p>But the original text of the Old Testament long before it was
combined with the text of the Jewish or Massoretic interpretation
had already undergone a somewhat similar change, the extent
of which was indeed far less, but also less clearly discoverable.
This change consisted in the insertion into the original text
of certain consonants which had come to be also used to express
vowel sounds: <i>e.g.</i> the Hebrew consonant corresponding to
<i>w</i> also expressed the vowel <i>o</i> or <i>u</i>, the consonant <i>h</i> the vowel
<i>a</i>, and so forth. For reasons suggested partly by the study of
Semitic inscriptions, partly by comparison of passages occurring
twice within the Old Testament, and partly by a comparison
of the Hebrew text with the Septuagint, it is clear that the authors
of the Old Testament (or at least most of them) themselves made
some use of these vowel consonants, but that in a great number
of cases the vowel consonants that stand in our present text
were inserted by transcribers and editors of the texts. Again,
and for similar reasons, it is probable that in many cases, if not
in all, the original texts were written without any clear division
of the consonants into words. In view of all this, the first
requisite for a critical treatment of the text of the Old Testament
is to consider the consonants by themselves, to treat every
vowel-consonant as <i>possibly</i> not original, and the existing
divisions of the text into words as original only in those cases
where they yield a sense better than any other possible division
(or, at least, as good). Certainly all this brings us face to face
with much ambiguity and demands increased skill in interpretation,
but anything short of it falls short also of strict critical
method. A perception of this has only been gradually reached,
and is even now none too general.</p>

<p>Apart from these changes in the history of the text, it has,
like all ancient texts, suffered from accidents of transmission,
from the unintentional mistakes of copyists. This fact was,
naturally enough and under the same dogmatic stress, denied
by those scholars who maintained that the vowels were an
integral part of the text. Here again we may single out Capellus
as a pioneer in criticism, in his <i>Critica sacra sive de variis quae
in sacris V. T. libris occurrunt lectionibus</i>, written in 1634, much
studied in MS. by scholars before its publication in 1650, and
unavailingly criticized by Buxtorf the younger in his <i>Anticritica
seu vindiciae veritatis hebraicae</i> (1653). Capellus drew conclusions
from such important facts as the occurrence of variations in
the two Hebrew texts of passages found twice in the Old Testament
itself, and the variations brought to light by a comparison
of the Jewish and Samaritan texts of the Pentateuch, the Hebrew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page860" id="page860"></a>860</span>
text and the Septuagint, the Hebrew text and New Testament
quotations from the Old Testament.</p>

<p>In order that the principles already perceived by Capellus
might be satisfactorily applied in establishing a critical text,
many things were needed; for example, a complete collation
of existing MSS. of the Jewish text and of the Samaritan text
of the Pentateuch, the establishing of a critical text of the Septuagint,
a careful study of the several versions directed to determining
when real variants are implied and what they are. Some of
this work has been accomplished: much of it remains to be done.</p>

<p>The Hebrew MSS. were collated by Kennicott and de Rossi
at the close of the 18th century, with sufficient thoroughness
to justify the important conclusion that all existing MSS.
reproduce a single recension. The Samaritan MSS. are still
very imperfectly collated; the same is true of the Syriac and
other versions except the Septuagint. In regard to the Septuagint,
though the work is by no means complete, much has been
done. For collection of material the edition of Holmes and
Parsons (Oxford, 1798-1827), with its magnificent critical
apparatus, is pre-eminent; the preparation of a similar edition,
on a rather smaller scale but embodying the results of fresh and
more careful collation, was subsequently undertaken by Cambridge
scholars.<a name="fa19a" id="fa19a" href="#ft19a"><span class="sp">19</span></a> These editions furnish the material, but neither
attempts the actual construction of a critical text of the version.
Some important contributions towards a right critical method
of using the material collected have been made&mdash;in particular
by Lagarde, who has also opened up a valuable line of critical
work, along which much remains to be done, by his restoration
of the Lucianic recension, one of the three great recensions of
the Greek text of the Old Testament which obtained currency
at the close of the 3rd and beginning of the 4th centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span></p>

<p>More especially since the time of Capellus the value of the
Septuagint for correcting the Hebrew text has been recognized;
but it has often been used uncritically, and the correctness of the
Hebrew text underlying it in comparison with the text of the
Hebrew MSS., though still perhaps most generally underestimated,
has certainly at times been exaggerated.</p>

<p>It has only been possible here to indicate in the briefest way
what is involved in the collection and critical sifting of the
extant evidence for the text of the Old Testament,
how much of the work has been done and how much
<span class="sidenote">Results of Criticism.</span>
remains; and with equal brevity it must suffice to
indicate the position which faces the textual critic when all
that can be done in this way has been done. In so far as it
is possible to recover the Hebrew text from which the Greek
version was made, it is possible to recover a form of the Hebrew
text current about 280 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> in the case of the Pentateuch, some
time before 100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> in the case of most of the rest of the Old
Testament. By comparison of the Hebrew MSS. it is not
difficult to recover the recension which with few and unimportant
variants they have perpetuated, and which may safely be
regarded as differing but slightly from the text current and
officially established before the end of the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> By
a comparison of these two lines of evidence we can approximate
to a text current about 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> or later; but for any errors
which had entered into the common source of these two forms
of the text we possess no documentary means of detection
whatsoever. The case then stands thus. Except by the obviously
absurd assumption of the infallibility of copyists for the centuries
before <i>c</i>. 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, we cannot escape the conclusion that <i>errors
lurk even where no variants now exist</i>, and that <i>such errors can
be corrected, if at all, only by conjectural emendation</i>. The dangers
of conjectural emendation are well known and apparent; large
numbers of such emendations have been ill-advised; but in the
case of many passages the only alternative for the textual critic
who is at once competent and honest is to offer such emendations
or to indicate that such passages are corrupt and the means of
restoring them lacking.</p>

<p>Conjectural emendations were offered by Capellus in the
17th, and by scholars such as C.F. Houbigant, Archbishop
Seeker, Bishop Lowth and J.D. Michaelis in the 18th century.
Some of these have approved themselves to successive generations
of scholars, who have also added largely to the store of such
suggestions; conjectural emendation has been carried furthest
by upholders of particular metrical theories (such as Bickell
and Duhm) which do not accommodate themselves well to the
existing text, and by T.K. Cheyne (in <i>Critica Biblica</i>, 1903),
whose restorations resting on a dubious theory of Hebrew history
have met with little approval, though his negative criticism
of the text is often keen and suggestive.</p>

<p>A model of the application of the various resources of Old
Testament textual criticism to the restoration of the text is
C.H. Cornill&rsquo;s <i>Das Buch des Propheten Ezechiel</i> (1886): outstanding
examples of important systematic critical notes are
J. Wellhausen&rsquo;s <i>Der Text der Bücher Samuelis</i> (1871) and S.R. Driver&rsquo;s
<i>Notes on the Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel</i> (1890). Haupt&rsquo;s
<i>Sacred Books of the Old Testament</i>, edited by various scholars,
was designed to present, when complete, a critical text of the
entire Old Testament with critical notes. The results of textual
criticism, including a considerable number of conjectural emendations,
are succinctly presented in Kittel&rsquo;s <i>Biblia Hebraica</i>
(1906); but the text here printed is the ordinary Massoretic
(vocalized) text. The valuable editions of the Old Testament
by Baer and Delitzsch, and by Ginsburg, contain <i>critical</i> texts
of the Jewish interpretation of Scripture, and therefore necessarily
<i>uncritical</i> texts of the Hebrew Old Testament itself: it
lies entirely outside their scope to give or even to consider the
evidence which exists for correcting the obvious errors in the
text of the Old Testament as received and perpetuated by the
Jewish interpreters. See also the authorities mentioned in the
following section.</p>
<div class="author">(G. B. G.*)</div>

<p class="pt2 center">4. <i>Higher Criticism.</i></p>

<p>We now pass on to consider the growth of literary and historic
criticism, which constitute the <i>Higher Criticism</i> as already
explained. Down to the Reformation conditions were unfavourable
to such criticism; the prevailing dogmatic use of
Scripture gave no occasion for inquiry into the human origins
or into the real purport and character of the several books.
Nevertheless we find some sporadic and tentative critical efforts
or questions. The most remarkable of these was made <i>outside</i>
the Church&mdash;a significant indication of the adverse effect of
the conditions within; the Neo-platonist philosopher Porphyry<a name="fa20a" id="fa20a" href="#ft20a"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
in the 3rd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, untrammelled by church tradition and
methods, anticipated one of the clearest and most important
conclusions of modern criticism: he detected the incorrectness
of the traditional ascription of Daniel to the Jewish captivity
in Babylon and discerned that the real period of its composition
was that of Antiochus Epiphanes, four centuries later. In the
mind even of Augustine (<i>Locutio in Jos. vi. 25</i>) questions
were raised by the occurrence of the formula &ldquo;until this day&rdquo; in
Jos. iv. 9, but were stilled by a rather clever though wrong use
of Jos. vi. 25; Abelard (<i>Heloissae Problema</i>, xli.) considers the
problem whether the narrative of Moses&rsquo;s death in Deut. contains
a prophecy by Moses or is the work of another and later writer,
while the Jewish scholar Ibn Ezra (Abenezra), in a cryptic note
on Deut. i. 1, which has been often quoted of late years, gathers
together several indications that point, as he appears to perceive,
to the post-Mosaic origin of the Pentateuch. Even rarer than
these rare perceptions of the evidence of the quasi-historical
books to their origin are such half-perceptions of the literary
origin of the prophetical books as is betrayed by Ibn Ezra, who
appears to question the Isaianic authorship of Is. xl.-lxvi., and
by Photius, patriarch of Constantinople in the 9th century,
who, according to Diestel (<i>Gesch. des A. T.</i>, 169), raises the
question why the sixth chapter of Isaiah, containing the inaugural
vision, does not stand at the beginning of the book.</p>

<p>Even after the Renaissance and the Reformation tradition
continued influential. For though the Reformers were critical
of the authority of ecclesiastical tradition in the matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page861" id="page861"></a>861</span>
the interpretation and use of Scripture, they were not immediately
<span class="sidenote">The Reformers.</span>
interested in literary and historical criticism, nor concerned
to challenge the whole body of traditional lore
on these matters. At the same time we can see from
Luther&rsquo;s attitude how the doctrine of the Reformers
(unlike that of the Protestant scholastics who came later)
admitted considerable freedom, in particular with reference
to the extent of the canon, but also to several questions of
higher criticism. Thus it is to Luther a matter of indifference
whether or not Moses wrote the Pentateuch; the books of
<i>Chronicles</i> he definitely pronounces less credible than those of
<i>Kings</i>, and he considers that the books of <i>Isaiah, Jeremiah</i> and
<i>Hosea</i> probably owe their present form to later hands. Carlstadt
again definitely denied the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch
on the ground that Moses could not have written the account of
his own death and yet that Deut. xxxiv. cannot be separated
from the rest of the Pentateuch. The later scholastic Protestant
doctrine of verbal infallibility necessarily encouraged critical
reaction and proved a widely extended retarding force far down
into the 19th century. Nevertheless criticism advanced by
slow degrees among individuals, now in the Roman Church,
now in the number of those who sat loosely to the restrictions
of either Roman or Protestant authority, and now among
Protestant scholars and theologians.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to refer here even briefly to all these,
and it may be more useful to select for somewhat full description,
as showing what could be achieved by, and what
limitations beset, even a critical spirit in the 17th
<span class="sidenote">Hobbes.</span>
century, the survey of the origin of the Old Testament given
by one such individual&mdash;Thomas Hobbes in his <i>Leviathan</i><a name="fa21a" id="fa21a" href="#ft21a"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
(published 1651) <i>c.</i> xxxiii. As far as possible this survey shall
be cited verbatim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Who were the original writers of the several books of Holy
Scripture has not been made evident by any sufficient testimony
of other history, which is the only proof of matter of fact; nor can
be, by any argument of natural reason: for reason serves only to
convince the truth, not of fact, but of consequence. The light
therefore that must guide us in this question, must be that which
is held out unto us from the books themselves: and this light,
though it shew us not the author of every book, yet it is not unuseful
to give us knowledge of the time wherein they were written.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And first, for the Pentateuch.... We read (Deut. xxxiv. 6)
concerning the sepulchre of Moses &lsquo;that no man knoweth of his
sepulchre to this day&rsquo;; that is, to the day wherein those words were
written. It is therefore manifest that these words were written
after his interment. For it were a strange interpretation to say
Moses spake of his own sepulchre, though by prophecy, that it was
not found to that day wherein he was yet living.&rdquo; The suggestion
that the last chapter only, not the whole Pentateuch, was written
later, is met by Hobbes by reference to Gen. xii. 6 (&ldquo;the Canaanite
was then in the land&rdquo;) and Num. xxi. 14 (citation from a book
relating the acts of Moses at the Red Sea and in Moab) and the
conclusion reached that &ldquo;the five books of Moses were written after
his time, though how long after is not so manifest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But though Moses did not compile those books entirely, and
in the form we have them, yet he wrote all that which he is there
said to have written: as, for example, the volume of the Law&rdquo;
contained &ldquo;as it seemeth&rdquo; in Deut. xi.-xxvii, &ldquo;and this is that Law
which ... having been lost, was long time after found again by
Hilkiah and sent to King Josias (2 Kings xxii. 8).&rdquo;</p>

<p>The books of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel are proved much
later than the times recorded in them by the numerous passages
which speak of customs, conditions, &amp;c., remaining &ldquo;unto this day,&rdquo;
and <i>Judges</i> in particular by xviii. 30, &ldquo;where it said that &lsquo;Jonathan
and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan, until the day of the
captivity of the land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for <i>Kings</i> and <i>Chronicles</i>, &ldquo;besides the places which
mention such monuments as, the writer saith, remained till his own days&rdquo;
(Hobbes here cites thirteen from Kings, two from Chron.), &ldquo;it is
argument sufficient that they were written after the captivity in
Babylon, that the history of them is continued till that time. For
the facts registered are always more ancient than the register; and
much more ancient than such books as make mention of and quote
the register, as these books do in divers places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ezra and Nehemiah were written after, Esther during, or after,
the captivity; Job, which is not a history but a philosophical poem,
at an uncertain date. The Psalms were written mostly by David,
but &ldquo;some of them after the return from the captivity, as the 137th
and 126th, whereby it is manifest that the psalter was compiled
and put into the form it now hath, after the return of the Jews from
Babylon.&rdquo; The compilation of Proverbs is later than any of those
whose proverbs are therein contained; but Ecclesiastes and Canticles
are wholly Solomon&rsquo;s except the titles. There is little noticeable in
Hobbes&rsquo; dating of the prophets, though he considers it &ldquo;not apparent&rdquo;
whether Amos wrote, as well as composed, his prophecy, or
whether Jeremiah and the other prophets of the time of Josiah
and Ezekiel, Daniel, Haggai and Zechariah, who lived in the
captivity, <i>edited</i> the prophecies ascribed to them. He concludes:
&ldquo;But considering the inscriptions, or titles of their books, it is manifest
enough that the whole Scripture of the Old Testament was set forth
in the form we have it after the return of the Jews from their captivity
in Babylon and before the time of Ptolemaeus Philadelphus.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Except in strangely making Zephaniah contemporary with
Isaiah, Hobbes&rsquo; conclusions, in so far as they differ from the
traditional views, have been confirmed by the more thorough
criticism of subsequent scholars. But apart from the special
conclusions, the opening and closing considerations contain clear
and important statements which still hold good. No fresh
discoveries since the time of Hobbes have furnished any &ldquo;testimony
of other history&rdquo; to the origin of the books of the Old
Testament: this must still be determined by the statements
and internal evidence of the Old Testament itself, and a deeper
criticism has given to the final consideration that the Old
Testament received its present form <i>after</i> the Exile a far greater
significance than Hobbes perhaps guessed.</p>

<p>But the limitations of Hobbes&rsquo; literary criticism judged from
our present standpoint are great. The considerations from
which he acutely and accurately draws far-reaching and
important conclusions might be suggested by a very superficial
examination of the literature; they involve, for example, no
special philological knowledge. The effect of a deeper criticism
has been (<i>a</i>) to give a more powerful support to some of Hobbes&rsquo;
conclusions; (<i>b</i>) to show that works (<i>e.g.</i> Ecclesiastes) whose
traditional antiquity is left unquestioned by him are in reality
of far more recent origin; (<i>c</i>) to eliminate the earlier sources
or elements in the writings which Hobbes was content to date
mainly or as a whole by their latest elements (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Pentateuch,
Judges, Kings</i>), and thus to give to these earlier sources an
historical value higher than that which would be safely attributed
to them as indistinguishable parts of a late compilation.</p>

<p>Hobbes argues in the case of the <i>Pentateuch</i> that two authors
are distinguishable&mdash;Moses and a much later compiler and
editor. Spinoza, whose conclusions in his <i>Tractatus
theologicopoliticus</i> (1671), <i>c.</i> viii. ix., had in general much in
common with Hobbes, drew attention in particular to the confused mixture
of law and narrative in the Pentateuch, the occurrence of
duplicate narratives and chronological incongruities. Father
Simon in his <i>Histoire critique du Vieux Testament</i> (1682) also
argues that the Pentateuch is the work of more than one author,
and makes an important advance towards a systematic analysis
of the separate elements by observing that the style varies,
being sometimes very curt and sometimes very copious &ldquo;although
the variety of the matter does not require it.&rdquo; But
none of these makes any attempt to carry through a continuous
analysis.</p>

<p>The first attempt of this kind is that of a French Catholic
physician, Jean Astruc. In a work published anonymously in
1753 under the title of <i>Conjectures sur les mémoires
originaux dont il paroît que Moyse s&rsquo;est servi pour
composer le livre de la Genèse</i>, he argued that in Genesis and
<span class="sidenote">Astruc.</span>
Ex. i. ii. Moses had used different documents, and that of these
the two chief were distinguished by their use of different divine
names&mdash;Elohim and Yahweh; by the use of this clue he gave
a detailed analysis of the passages belonging to the several
documents. Astruc&rsquo;s criteria were too slight to give to all the
details of his analysis anything approaching a final analysis;
but later criticism has shown that his criteria, so far as they
went, were valid, and his results, broadly speaking, sound
though incomplete: and, moreover, they have abundantly
justified his really important fundamental theory that the
documents used by the compiler of the <i>Pentateuch</i> have been
incorporated so much as they lay before him that we can get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page862" id="page862"></a>862</span>
behind the compiler to the earlier sources and thus push back
the evidence of much of the Pentateuch beyond the date of its
compilation to the earlier date of the sources. In identifying
the compiler with Moses, Astruc failed to profit from some of
his predecessors: and the fact that he held to the traditional
(Mosaic) origin of the Pentateuch may have prevented him from
seeing the similar facts which would have led him to continue
his analysis into the remaining books of the Pentateuch.</p>

<p>For subsequent developments, and the fruitful results of
documentary analysis as applied to the Pentateuch and other
composite books, which cannot be dealt with in any detail here,
reference must be made to the special articles on the books of
the Old Testament.</p>

<p>The year of the publication of Astruc&rsquo;s book saw also the
publication of Bishop Lowth&rsquo;s <i>De sacra poesi Hebraeorum</i>;
later Lowth published a new translation of Isaiah with
notes (1778). Lowth&rsquo;s contribution to a more critical
<span class="sidenote">Lowth.</span>
appreciation of the Old Testament lies in his perception of the
nature and significance of parallelism in Hebrew poetry, in his
discernment of the extent to which the prophetical books are
poetical in form, and in his treatment of the Old Testament as the
expression of the thought and emotions of a people&mdash;in a word,
as <i>literature</i>. Both Lowth&rsquo;s works were translated and became
influential in Germany.</p>

<p>In spite of these earlier achievements, it is J.G. Eichhorn who
has, not without reason, been termed the &ldquo;founder of modern
Old Testament criticism.&rdquo; Certainly the publication
of his <i>Einleitung</i> (<i>Introduction to the Old Testament</i>),
<span class="sidenote">Eichhorn.</span>
in 1780-1783, is a landmark in the history of Old Testament
criticism. An intimate friend of Herder, himself keenly interested
in literature, he naturally enough treats the Old Testament as
literature&mdash;like Lowth, but more thoroughly; and, as an
Oriental scholar, he treats it as an Oriental literature. In both
respects he was to be widely followed. His <i>Introduction</i>, consisting
of three closely packed volumes dealing with textual
as well as literary criticism, is the first comprehensive treatment
of the entire Old Testament as literature. Much of the voluminous
detailed work in this and other works is naturally enough
provisional, but in the <i>Introduction</i> there emerge most of the
broad conclusions of literary criticism (sometimes incomplete)
which, after more than a century of keen examination by scholars
unwilling to admit them, have passed by more or less general
consent into the number of historical certainties or high probabilities.
With his wide linguistic knowledge Eichhorn perceived
that the language alone (though he also adduces other considerations)
betrays the late origin of <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, which he places in
the Persian Period (538-332 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>): <i>Canticles</i>, too, preserves
linguistic features which are not of the Solomonic age. He
analyses significant stylistic peculiarities such as occur, <i>e.g</i>., in
<i>Isaiah</i> xxiv.-xxvii. For various reasons (here following Koppe,
who just previously in additions to his translation of Lowth&rsquo;s
<i>Isaiah</i> had shown himself the pioneer of the higher criticism of
the book of Isaiah) he argues that &ldquo;in our <i>Isaiah</i> are many
oracles not the work of this prophet.&rdquo; In other directions the
still powerful influence of tradition affects Eichhorn. He
maintains the exilic origin of parts of <i>Daniel</i>, though he is
convinced (here again in part by language) of the later origin of
other parts. His Pentateuchal criticism is limited by the
tradition of Mosaic authorship: but even within these limits
he achieves much. He carries through, as Astruc had done, the
analysis of <i>Genesis</i> into (primarily) two documents; he draws
the distinction between the Priests&rsquo; Code, of the middle books of
the Pentateuch, and <i>Deuteronomy</i>, the people&rsquo;s law book; and
admits that even the books that follow Genesis consist of different
documents, many incomplete and fragmentary (whence the
theory became known as the &ldquo;Fragment-hypothesis&rdquo;), but all
the work of Moses and some of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Other literary critics of the same period or a little later are
Alex. Geddes, a Scottish Catholic priest, who projected, and in
part carried out (1792-1800), a critically annotated new translation
of the Old Testament, and argued therein that the Pentateuch
ultimately rests on a variety of sources partly written, partly
oral, but was compiled in Canaan probably in the reign of
Solomon; K.D. Ilgen, the discoverer (1798) that there were
two distinct documents in Genesis using the divine name Elohim,
and consequently that there were <i>three</i> main sources in the books,
not two, as Astruc and Eichhorn had conjectured; and J.S.
Vater, the elaborator of the &ldquo;Fragment-hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the next distinct stage is reached when we come to De
Wette, whose contributions to Biblical learning were many and
varied, but who was pre-eminent in <i>historical criticism</i>.
He carried criticism beyond literary analysis and
<span class="sidenote">De Wette.</span>
literary appreciation to the task of determining the worth of the
documents as records, the validity of the evidence. His peculiar
qualities were conspicuous in his early and exceedingly influential
work&mdash;the <i>Beiträge zur Einleitung in das Alte Testament</i> (1806-1807).
In the introduction to vol. ii. he carefully analyses the
principles of sound historical method and the essentials of a
trustworthy historical record. These principles he applied to
the Old Testament, firstly to the <i>Books of Chronicles</i>, and then
to the Pentateuch. The untrustworthiness of <i>Chronicles</i>&mdash;briefly
admitted by Luther&mdash;he proved in detail, and so cleared
the way for that truer view of the history and religion of Israel
which the treatment of <i>Chronicles</i> as a trustworthy record of the
past hopelessly obscured. In the criticism of the Pentateuch
his most influential and enduring contributions to criticism are
his proof that <i>Deuteronomy</i> is a work of the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and
his insistence that the theory of the Mosaic origin of all the
institutions described in the Pentateuch is incompatible with the
history of Israel as described in the historical books, <i>Judges</i>,
<i>Samuel</i> and <i>Kings</i>.</p>

<p>Strong in historical criticism, De Wette was weak in historical
construction. But what he failed to give, Ewald supplied, and
if more of De Wette&rsquo;s than of Ewald&rsquo;s work still stands
to-day, that is but an illustration of the melancholy
<span class="sidenote">Ewald.</span>
fact that in history negative criticism is surer than positive
construction. But Ewald&rsquo;s <i>History of the People of Israel</i> (1843-1859)
was the first great attempt to synthesize the results of
criticism and to present the history of Israel as a great reality of
the past. By the force of his wide learning and even more of his
personality, Ewald exercised for long an all-pervading and
almost irresistible influence. He closes one epoch of Old Testament
criticism; by his influence he retards the development of
the next. Before passing to the new epoch it must suffice to
make a simple reference to the philological work of Gesenius
and Ewald, which assisted a sounder exegesis and so secured for
later criticism a more stable basis.</p>

<p>The next stage brings us to the critical theories or conclusions
which at first gradually and then rapidly, in spite of the keenest
criticisms directed against them both by those who
clung more or less completely to tradition and by the
<span class="sidenote">Vatke; Reuss.</span>
representatives of the earlier critical school, gained
increasing acceptance, until to-day they dominate Old Testament
study. The historico-critical starting-point of the movement
was really furnished by De Wette: but it was Vatke who, in
his <i>Biblische Theologie wissenschaftlich dargestellt</i> (1835), first
brought out its essential character. The fundamental peculiarity
of the movement lies in the fact that it is a criticism of what is
supreme in Israel&mdash;its religion, and that it has rendered possible
a true appreciation of this by showing that, like all living and
life-giving systems of thought, belief and practice, the religion of
Israel was subject to development. It seized on the prophetic
element, and not the ceremonial, as containing what is essential
and unique in the religion of Israel. In literary criticism its
fundamental thesis, stated independently of Vatke and in the
same year by George in <i>Die älteren jüdischen Feste</i>, and in a
measure anticipated by Reuss, who in 1832 was maintaining in
his academical lectures that the prophets were older than the
Law and the Psalms more recent than both, is that the chronological
order of the three main sources of the Hexateuch is (1) the
prophetic narratives (JE), (2) Deuteronomy, (3) the Priestly
Code (P), the last being post-exilic. This entirely reversed the
prevailing view that P with its exact details and developed
ceremonial and sacerdotal system was at once the earliest portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page863" id="page863"></a>863</span>
of the Pentateuch and the <i>Grundschrift</i> or foundation of the
whole&mdash;a view that was maintained by Ewald and, though with
very important modifications, to the last by A. Dillmann (d. 1894).
Inherent in this view of religious development and the
new critical position were far-reaching changes in the literary,
historical and religious criticism of the Old Testament: these
have been gradually rendered clear as the fundamental positions
on which they rest have been secured by the manifold work of
two generations of scholars.</p>

<p>Nearly a generation passed before Vatke&rsquo;s point of view gained
any considerable number of adherents. This is significant. In
part it may fairly be attributed to the retarding
influence of the school of Ewald, but in large part also
<span class="sidenote">Graf; Kuenen; Wellhausen; Colenso.</span>
to the fact that Vatke, a pupil of Hegel, had developed
his theory on <i>a priori</i> grounds in accordance with the
principles of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy of history. It was
only after a fresh and keener observation of <i>facts</i> that the new
theory made rapid progress. For that, when it came, much was
due to the work of Graf (a pupil of Reuss, whose <i>Geschichtliche
Bücher des Alten Testaments</i> appeared in 1866); to the Dutch
scholar Kuenen, who, starting from the earlier criticism, came
over to the new, made it the basis of his <i>Religion of Israel</i>
(1869-1870), a masterly work and a model of sound method, and
continued to support it by a long series of critical essays in the
<i>Theologisch Tijdschrift</i>; and to Wellhausen, who displayed an
unrivalled combination of grasp of details and power of historical
construction: his <i>Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels</i> was
published in 1878 and translated into English in 1885; the
history itself, <i>Israelitische u. jüdische Geschichte</i>, followed
twenty years later, after much further critical work had been done in
the meantime. Not a little also was due to Colenso (<i>The
Pentateuch ... critically examined</i>, pt. i., 1862), who, though he
never entirely accepted the new position, contributed by his
searching analysis of the unreality of P&rsquo;s narrative to the
formation (for example, in the mind of Kuenen) or ratification of the
judgment on that work which is fundamental to the general theory.</p>

<p>This sketch of the critical movement has now been brought
down to the point at which the comprehensive conclusions
which still dominate Old Testament study gained clear expression
and were shown to be drawn from the observation
of a large body of facts. It does not fall within the scope of
this article to examine the validity of these conclusions, nor
even to notice the various subsidiary or consequential conclusions.
Nor again is it possible to survey the more special
developments of literary criticism which have later emerged,
amongst which one of the most important has been the radical
examination of the prophetic writings introduced and developed
by (amongst others) Stade, Wellhausen, Duhm, Cheyne, Marti.<a name="fa22a" id="fa22a" href="#ft22a"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
The starting-point of this newer criticism of the prophets is
the clearer practical recognition of the fact that all pre-exilic
prophecy has come down to us in the works of post-exilic editors,
and that for the old statement of the problem of the prophetic
books&mdash;What prophecies or elements in Isaiah, Jeremiah and
the rest are later than these prophets?&mdash;is to be substituted
the new critical question&mdash;From these post-exilic collections
how are the pre-exilic elements to be extracted? Bound up
with this question of literary criticism is the very important
question of the origin and development of the Messianic idea.</p>

<p>But two things, the extent of the influence of criticism and
the relation of archaeology and criticism, yet remain for
consideration, in the course of which it will be possible just to
indicate some other problems awaiting solution.</p>

<p>It is one thing for scholars to reach conclusions: it is another
for these conclusions to exercise a wide influence in the Churches
and over general culture. In the 16th century we find <i>obiter
dicta</i> of the Reformers challenging traditional opinions on the
<span class="sidenote">Influence of Criticism.</span>
origin and character of the Old Testament; in the 17th century,
among certain isolated scholars, elementary critical
surveys of the whole field, which exercised, however, no
extensive influence. Nor was it till late in the 18th
century that criticism seriously challenged the dominance
of the Protestant scholastic treatment of the Old Testament on
the one hand, and the rough and ready, uncritical explanations
or depreciations of the Rationalists on the other. But Eichhorn&rsquo;s
<i>Introduction</i> appealed to more than technical scholars: its influence
was great, and from that time forward criticism gradually
or even rapidly extended its sway in Germany. Very different was
the case in England; after Geddes and Lowth, at the close of the
18th, till far down into the 19th century, the attitude even of
scholars (with rare exceptions) was hostile to critical developments,
and no independent critical work was done. Pusey indeed studied
under Eichhorn, and in his <i>Historical Enquiry into the probable
causes of the Rationalist Character lately predominant in German
Theology</i> (1828-1830) speaks sympathetically of the attitude
of the Reformers on the question of Scripture and in condemnation
of the later Protestant scholastic doctrine; but even in this
book he shows no receptivity for any of the actual critical
conclusions of Eichhorn and his successors, and subsequently threw
the weight of his learning against critical conclusions&mdash;notably
in his <i>Commentary on Daniel</i> (1864). Dean Stanley owed
something to Ewald and spoke warmly of him, but the Preface to
the <i>History of the Jewish Church</i> in which he does so bears
eloquent testimony to the general attitude towards Old Testament
criticism in 1862, of which we have further proof in the
almost unanimous disapprobation and far-spread horror with
which Colenso&rsquo;s <i>Pentateuch</i>, pt. i., was met on its publication in
the same year.</p>

<p>From 1869 T.K. Cheyne worked indefatigably as a resourceful
pioneer, but for many years, in view of the prevailing temper,
with &ldquo;extreme self-suppression&rdquo; and &ldquo;willingness to concede
to tradition all that could with any plausibility be conceded.&rdquo;
(Cheyne, <i>Origin of the Psalter</i>, p. 15); more especially is his
influence observable after 1890, when he published his Bampton
Lectures, the <i>Origin of the Psalter</i>, a work of vast learning and
keen penetration, without restraint on the freedom of his
judgment&mdash;always stimulating to students and fellow-workers,
though by no means always carrying large numbers with him.
From about 1880 the prevailing temper had changed; within
a decade of this date the change had become great; since then
the influence of Old Testament criticism has grown with increased
acceleration. The change in the former period with regard to
a single point, which is however typical of many, is briefly
summed up by Dr Cheyne: &ldquo;In 1880 it was still a heresy to
accept with all its consequences the plurality of authorship of
the Book of Isaiah; in 1890 to a growing school of church-students
this has become an indubitable fact&rdquo; (<i>Origin of the
Psalter</i>, xv.). By 1906 this plurality of authorship had become
almost a commonplace of the market. Many, particularly of
late, have contributed to the wide distribution, if not of the
critical spirit itself, yet at least of a knowledge of its conclusions.
To two only of the most influential is it possible to make more
definite reference&mdash;to W. Robertson Smith and S.R. Driver.
From 1875 onwards Smith contributed to the 9th edition of the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> a long series of important articles,
which, together with the articles of Cheyne, Wellhausen and
others, made that work an important factor in the change
which was to pass over English thought in regard to the Bible;
in 1878, by his pleadings in the trial for heresy brought against
him on the ground of these articles, he turned a personal defeat
in the immediate issue into a notable victory for the cause which
led to his condemnation; and subsequently (in 1880), in two
series of lectures, afterwards published<a name="fa23a" id="fa23a" href="#ft23a"><span class="sp">23</span></a> and widely read, he
gave a brilliant, and, as it proved, to a rapidly increasing number
a convincing exposition of the criticism of the literature, history
and religion of Israel, which was already represented in Germany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page864" id="page864"></a>864</span>
by Wellhausen and in Holland by Kuenen. In 1891 Dr Driver published
his <i>Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament</i>
(6th ed., 1897); less popular in form than Smith&rsquo;s lectures, it
was a more systematic and comprehensive survey of the whole
field of the literary criticism of the Old Testament. The position
of the author as regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford and
canon of Christ Church in succession to Pusey, and his
well-established reputation as a profound Hebrew scholar,
commanded wide attention; the qualities of the book itself&mdash;its
marked  sobriety, its careful discrimination between the
differing degrees of probability attaching to various conclusions
and suggestions, and in general its soundness of method&mdash;rapidly
extended the understanding of what Old Testament criticism is
and commanded acceptance of the well-established conclusions.</p>

<p>No less rapid has been the change in America during the same
period, nor less numerous the scholars well equipped to pursue
the detailed investigation involved in critical study or those who
have shown ability in popular presentations of the critical
standpoint.<a name="fa24a" id="fa24a" href="#ft24a"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Pre-eminent amongst these is C.A. Briggs, whose
influence has been due in part to a large and varied body of
work (<i>Biblical Study</i>, 1883, and many articles and volumes
since) and in part to his organization of united critical,
international and interconfessional labour, the chief fruits of which
have been the <i>Hebrew Lexicon</i> (based on Gesenius, and edited
by F. Brown, one of the most eminent of American scholars,
S.R. Driver and himself), and the <i>International Critical
Commentary</i>. Other important works in which English and American
scholars have co-operated are the <i>Encyclopaedia Biblica</i>
(1899-1903) and Hastings&rsquo; <i>Bible Dictionary</i> (1898-1904)&mdash;the
latter less radical, but yet on the whole based on acceptance of the
fundamental positions of Vatke, Graf, Wellhausen. Between either of
these and Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i> (1863) yawns a great
gulf. Space forbids any attempt to sketch here the special
growth of criticism in other countries, such as France, where
the brilliant genius of Renan was in part devoted to the Old
Testament, or within the Roman Catholic Church, which possesses
in Père Lagrange, for example, a deservedly influential critical
scholar, and in the <i>Revue Biblique</i> an organ which devotes
much attention to the critical study of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Rapid and extensive as has been the spread of critical methods,
there have not been lacking <i>anticritica</i>. Many of these have
been not only apologetic, but unscholarly; that is, however, not
the case with all. In Dr James Orr&rsquo;s learned work, <i>The Problem
of the Old Testament considered with reference to Recent Criticism</i>
(1906), the author&rsquo;s chief aim is to prove insecure the fundamental
positions of the now dominant school of criticism.</p>

<p>In view of extensive misconception occasioned by many of these
<i>anticritica</i>, it needs to be pointed out that terms like
&ldquo;criticism,&rdquo; &ldquo;higher criticism,&rdquo; &ldquo;critics&rdquo; are often loosely used:
criticism is a method, its results are many. Again, many of the results
or conclusions of criticism are mutually independent, while others
are interrelated and depend for their validity on the validity of
others. For example, among the generally or largely accepted
critical conclusions are these: (1) Moses is not the author
of the whole Pentateuch; (2) Isaiah is not the author
of Is. xl.-lxvi.; (3) the book of Daniel was written in the 2nd
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; (4) the  Priestly Code is post-exilic; (5) most
of the Psalms are post-exilic. Now 1, 2, 3 are absolutely
independent&mdash;if 1 were proved false, 2 and 3 would still stand;
and so with 2 and 3; so also 2 and 3 could be proved false
without in any way affecting the validity of 4. On the other
hand, if 1 were disproved, 4 would immediately fall through,
and the strength of 5 would be weakened (as it would also by the
disproof of 2), because the argument for the date of many Psalms
is derived from religious ideas and the significance of these
varies greatly according as the Priestly Code is held to be early
or late. In view of the number of critical conclusions and
the mutual independence of many of them, &ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo;
can only be overthrown by proving the application of criticism to
the Old Testament to be in itself unlawful, or else by proving
the falseness or inconclusiveness of all its mutually independent
judgments one by one. On examination, the authors of <i>anticritica</i>
are generally found to disown, tacitly or openly, the first
of these alternatives; for example, Prof. Sayce, who frequently
takes the field against the &ldquo;higher criticism,&rdquo; and denies, without,
however, disproving, the validity of the literary analysis of the
Hexateuch, nevertheless himself asserts that &ldquo;no one can study
the Pentateuch ... without perceiving that it is a compilation,
and that its author, or authors, has made use of a
large variety of older materials,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it has probably
received its final shape at the hands of Ezra&rdquo; (<i>Early History
of the Hebrews</i>, 129 and 134). This is significant enough; Prof.
Sayce, the most brilliant and distinguished of the &ldquo;anti-critics,&rdquo;
does not really reoccupy the position of the &ldquo;able and pious
men&rdquo; of the mid-19th century, to whom &ldquo;even to speak of any
portion of the Bible as a history&rdquo; was &ldquo;an outrage upon religion&rdquo;
(Stanley, <i>Jewish Church</i>, Preface); these may still have pious,
but they have no longer scholarly successors. Prof. Sayce
travels farther back, it is true, but on critical lines: he abandons
the Pentateuchal criticism of the 20th century, to reoccupy the
critical position of Hobbes, Spinoza and Simon in the 17th
century&mdash;whether reasonably or not must here be left an open question.</p>

<p>Briefly, in conclusion, it remains to consider the relation of
Archaeology to Criticism, partly because it is frequently
asserted in the loose language just discussed that
Archaeology has overthrown Criticism, or in
<span class="sidenote">Archeology and Criticism.</span>
particular the &ldquo;higher criticism,&rdquo; and partly because
Archaeology has stimulated and forced to the front certain
important critical questions.</p>

<p>More especially since the middle of the 19th century the
decipherment of Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions and systematic
excavation in Palestine and other parts of the East have supplied
a multitude of new facts bearing more or less directly on the Old
Testament. What has been the general effect of these new facts on
traditional theories or critical conclusions?</p>

<p>(1) <i>Literary Criticism.</i>&mdash;No discovery has yielded any direct
testimony as to the authorship of any book of the Bible, or
as to the mode or date of its composition. Any documentary
analysis of the Pentateuch may be right or wrong; but archaeology
contributes nothing either one way or another as to the
answer. On the other hand, archaeology has in some cases
greatly strengthened the critical judgment that certain writings
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>Daniel</i>, the story of Joseph in <i>Genesis</i>) are
not contemporary with the events described.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Historical Criticism.</i>&mdash;Here the gain has been more direct;
<i>e.g.</i> the Assyrian inscriptions have furnished independent
evidence of the relations of certain Hebrew kings (Ahab, Jehu,
Ahaz) with the Assyrians, and thus supported more or less
completely the evidence of the Old Testament on these points:
they have also served to clear up in part the confused chronology
of the Hebrews as given in the books of <i>Kings</i>. But above all
archaeology has immensely increased our knowledge of the
nations among which Israel was placed, and of the political
powers which from time to time held Palestine in subjection.
In this way archaeology has greatly helped to bring the history
of Israel into relation with the history of the ancient East,
and in so doing has raised important questions as to the origin
of Hebrew culture. For example, the recent discovery of
the Code of Khammurabi, which contains some remarkable
resemblances to the Pentateuchal codes, raises the question of
the relation of Hebrew to Babylonian law. On the other
hand, there are certain great historical questions which have
been greatly affected by criticism, but on which archaeology
has hitherto shed no light.  For example, much as archaeology
has increased our knowledge of the conditions obtaining in
Palestine before the Hebrew invasion, it has so far contributed
nothing to our knowledge of the Hebrew nation before that time
beyond the statement in the now famous stele of Merenptah
(Mineptah) (<i>c.</i> 1270 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), discovered in 1896, &ldquo;Ysirael is desolated,
its seed is not,&rdquo; and a few possible but vague and uncertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page865" id="page865"></a>865</span>
allusions to particular tribes. It has contributed nothing
whatsoever to our knowledge of any Hebrew individual of this
period,<a name="fa25a" id="fa25a" href="#ft25a"><span class="sp">25</span></a> and consequently what elements of history underlie
the stories in Genesis, in so far as they relate to the Hebrew
patriarchs, must still be determined, if at all, by a critical study of
the Old Testament. The story in Gen. xiv. is no exception to this
statement: archaeology has made probable the historic reality
of Chedorlaomer, which some critics had previously divined; it
has not proved the historical reality of the patriarch Abraham
or the part played by him in the story, which some critics,
whether rightly or wrongly, had questioned. The Dutch scholar
Kosters called in question the return of the Jews in the days
of Cyrus; his view, adopted by many, has hardly obtained, as
yet at all events, the weight of critical judgment: here again,
unfortunately, archaeology at present is silent.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Criticism of Religion.</i>&mdash;Here, perhaps, archaeology has
contributed most new material, with the result that religious
terms, ideas, institutions, once supposed to be peculiar to Israel,
are now seen to be common to them and other nations; in some
cases, moreover, priority clearly does not lie with the Hebrews,
as, for example, in the case of the materials (as distinct from the
spirit in which they are worked up) of the stories of Creation
and the Flood. Of late, too, it has been much argued, and often
somewhat confidently maintained, that Hebrew monotheism
is derivative from Babylonian monotheism.</p>

<p>This and similar questions, leading up to the ultimate and
supreme question&mdash;Wherein does lie the uniqueness of Israel&rsquo;s
religion?&mdash;are among those which will require in the future
renewed examination in the light of a critical study alike of the
Old Testament and of all the relevant material furnished by
archaeology. Archaeology has not yet found the key to every
unopened door; but it has already done enough to justify the
surmise that if criticism had not already disintegrated the
traditional theories of the Old Testament, archaeology in the
latter half of the 19th century would itself have initiated the
process.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;Much of the details and results of criticism and
the special literature will be found in the articles in the present work

<p class="pt2 center">5. <i>Old Testament Chronology</i>.</p>

<p>A sense of the importance of a fixed standard of chronology
was only acquired gradually in the history of the world. Nations
in a primitive state of civilization were not, and are not, conscious
of the need. When the need began to be felt events were probably
at first dated by the regnal years of kings; the reigns of
successive kings were then arranged in order, and grouped, if
necessary, in dynasties, and thus a fixed standard was gradually
constructed. Particular states also not unfrequently introduced
fixed eras, which obtained a more or less extensive currency, as
the era of the first Olympiad (776 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), of the foundation
of Rome (753 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and of the Seleucidae at Antioch (312 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
which is followed by the Jewish author of the first book of
Maccabees. Some of the earliest documents which we possess
are dated by the year in which some noticeable event took
place, as in contract-tablets of the age of Sargon of Agade
(Akkad) (3800 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, or, according to other authorities, 2800 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
&ldquo;In the year in which Sargon conquered the land of Amurru
[the Amorites]&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;In the year in which Samsu-ditana
[<i>c</i>. 1950 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>] made the statue of Marduk&rdquo;: Is. vi. 1 (&ldquo;In the year
of King Uzziah&rsquo;s death&rdquo;), xiv. 28, xx. 1, are examples of this
method of dating found even in the Old Testament. In process
of time, however, the custom of dating by the regnal year of the
king became general. The Babylonians and Assyrians were
probably the first to construct and employ a fixed chronological
standard; and the numerous contract-tablets, and list of kings
and yearly officials, discovered within recent years, afford striking
evidence of the precision with which they noted chronological
details. Biblical chronology is, unfortunately, in many respects
uncertain. Prior to the establishment of the monarchy the
conditions for securing an exact and consecutive chronology did
not exist; the dates in the earlier period of the history, though
apparently in many cases precise, being in fact added long after
the events described, and often (as will appear below) resting
upon an artificial basis, so that the precision is in reality illusory.
And after the establishment of the monarchy, though the conditions
for an accurate chronology now existed, errors by some
means or other found their way into the figures; so that the
dates, as we now have them, are in many cases at fault by as
much as two to three decades of years. The <i>exact</i> dates of events
in Hebrew history can be determined only when the figures
given in the Old Testament, can be checked and, if necessary,
corrected by the contemporary monuments of Assyria and
Babylonia, or (as in the post-exilic period) by the knowledge
which we independently possess of the chronology of the Persian
kings. In the following parts of this article the chronological
character of each successive period of the Old Testament history
will be considered and explained as far as the limits of space at
the writer&rsquo;s disposal permit.</p>

<p>I. <i>From the Creation of Man to the Exodus.</i>&mdash;In the whole of
this period the chronology, in so far as it consists of definite
figures, depends upon that part of the Pentateuch which is called
by critics the &ldquo;Priestly Narrative.&rdquo; The figures are in most,
if not in all cases artificial, though the means now fail us of
determining upon what principles they were calculated. It is also
to be noted that in the Samaritan text of the Pentateuch, and in
the LXX., the figures, especially in the period from the Creation
to the birth of Abraham, differ considerably from those given in
the Hebrew, yielding in Sam. a lower, but in the LXX. a much
higher total. The following tables will make the details clear:&mdash;</p>

<p>The figures in parentheses indicate the entire ages assigned to
the several patriarchs; these are generally the same in the three
texts. The Sam., however, it will be noticed, makes in three
cases the father&rsquo;s age at the birth of his eldest son less than it is in
the Heb. text, while the LXX. makes it in several cases as much
as 100 years higher, the general result of these differences being
that the total in the Sam. is 349 years less than in the Heb.,
while in the LXX. it is 606 years more. The names, it need
hardly be remarked, belong to the prehistoric period, and
equally with the figures are destitute of historical value.</p>

<p>The variations are analogous to those under (1), except that
here the birth-years of the patriarchs in both Sam. and LXX.
differ more consistently in one direction, being, viz., almost
uniformly higher by 100 years. It has been much debated, in
both cases, which of the three texts preserves the original figures.
In (2) it is generally agreed that the Heb. does this, the figures in
Sam. and LXX. having been arbitrarily increased for the purpose
of lengthening the entire period. The majority of scholars hold
the same view in regard also to (1); but Dillmann gives here the
preference to the figures of the Sam. The figures, of course, in no
case possess historical value: accepting even Ussher&rsquo;s date of the
Exodus, 1491 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, which is earlier than is probable, we should
obtain from them for the creation of man 4157 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, or (LXX.)
5328,<a name="fa29a" id="fa29a" href="#ft29a"><span class="sp">29</span></a> and for the confusion of tongues, which, according to
Gen. xi. 1-9, immediately followed the Flood, 2501 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, or
(LXX.) 3066 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> But the monuments of Egypt and Babylonia
make it certain that man must have appeared upon the earth
long before either 4157 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> or 5328 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; and numerous
inscriptions, written in three distinct languages&mdash;Egyptian,
Sumerian and Babylonian&mdash;are preserved dating from an age
considerably earlier than either 2501 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> or 3066 <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa30a" id="fa30a" href="#ft30a"><span class="sp">30</span></a> The
figures of Gen. v. and xi. thus merely indicate the manner in
which the author of the Priestly Narrative&mdash;and probably to
some extent tradition before him&mdash;pictured the course of these
early ages of the world&rsquo;s history. The ages assigned to the several
patriarchs (except Enoch) in Gen. v. are much greater than those
assigned to the patriarchs mentioned in Gen. xi., and similarly
the ages in Gen. xi. 10-18 are higher than those in Gen. xi. 19-26;
it is thus a collateral aim of the author to exemplify the
supposed gradual diminution in the normal years of human life.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Babylonians, according to Berossus, supposed that there
were ten antediluvian kings, who they declared had reigned for
the portentous period of 432,000 years: 432,000 years, however,
it has been ingeniously pointed out by Oppert (<i>Gott. Gel. Nachrichten</i>,
1877, p. 205 ff.) = 86,400 <i>lustra</i>, while 1656 years (the Heb. date of
the Flood) = 86,400 <i>weeks</i> (1656 = 72 × 23; and 23 years being = 8395
days + 5 intercalary days = 8400 days = 1200 weeks); and hence the
inference has been drawn that the two periods have in some way
been developed from a common basis, the Hebrews taking as their
unit a week, where the Babylonians took a <i>lustrum</i> of 5 years.</p>

</table></div>

<p>On these figures the following remarks may be made:&mdash;(i.) In
Genesis the chronology of the Priestly Narrative (&ldquo;P&rdquo;)
is not consistent with the chronology of the other parts of
the book (&ldquo;JE&rdquo;). Three or four illustrations will suffice:
(<i>a</i>) The author of Gen. xii. 10-20 evidently pictures Sarai as
a comparatively young woman, yet according to P (xii. 4, xvii. 17)
she was 65 years old. (<i>b</i>) In Gen. xxi. 15 it is clearly implied
that Ishmael has been <i>carried</i> by his mother, yet according to
xvi. 16, xxi. 5, 8, he must have been at least 15 years old.
(<i>c</i>) In Gen. xxvii. Isaac is to all appearance on his death-bed
(cf. ver. 2), yet according to P (xxv. 26, xxvi. 34, xxxv. 28) he
survived for <i>eighty</i> years, dying at the age of 180. Ussher and
others, arguing back from the dates in xlvii. 9, xlv. 6, xli. 46, xxxi. 41,
infer that Jacob&rsquo;s flight to Haran took place in his 77th year.
This reduces the 80 years to 43 years, though that is scarcely
less incredible. It involves, moreover, the incongruity of
supposing that <i>thirty-seven</i> years elapsed between Esau&rsquo;s
marrying his Hittite wives (xxvi. 34) and Rebekah&rsquo;s expressing her
apprehensions (xxvii. 46) lest Jacob, then aged seventy-seven,
should follow his brother&rsquo;s example. (<i>d</i>) In Gen. xliv. 20 Benjamin
is described as a &ldquo;little one&rdquo;; in P, almost immediately
afterwards (xlvi. 21), he appears as the father of ten sons; for
a similar anomaly in xlvi. 12, see the <i>Oxford Hexateuch</i>, i.
p. 25n. (ii.) The ages to which the various patriarchs lived (Abraham,
175; Isaac, 180; Jacob, 147), though not so extravagant as
those of the antediluvian patriarchs, or (with one exception) as
those of the patriarchs between Noah and Abraham, are much
greater than is at all probable in view of the structure and
constitution of the human body. (iii.) The plain intention of
Ex. xii 40, 41 is to describe the Israelites as having dwelt in
Egypt for 430 years, which is also in substantial agreement with
the earlier passage, Gen. xv. 13 (&ldquo;shall sojourn in a land that is
not theirs, ... and they shall afflict them 400 years&rdquo;). It does
not, however, accord with other passages, which assign only four
generations from Jacob&rsquo;s children to Moses (Ex. vi. 16-20; Num.
xxvi. 5-9; cf. Gen. xv. 16), or five to Joshua (Josh. vii. 1); and
for this reason, no doubt, the Sam. and LXX. read in Ex. xii. 40,
&ldquo;The sojourning of the children of Israel in the land of
Egypt, <i>and in the land of Canaan</i>, was 430 years,&rdquo; reducing the
period of the sojourn in Egypt to half of that stated in the
Hebrew text, viz. 215 years. This computation attained
currency among the later Jews (Josephus and others; cf. the
&ldquo;400 years&rdquo; of Gal. iii. 17). The forced and unnatural rendering
of Ex. xii. 40 in the A.V. (contrast R.V.), which was followed
by Ussher, is intended for the purpose of making it possible.
From the facts that have been here briefly noted it must be
evident how precarious and, in parts, how impossible the Biblical
chronology of this period is. (iv.) It has been observed as
remarkable that 2666, the number of years (in the Hebrew text)
from the Creation of Man to the Exodus, is, in round numbers,
just two-thirds of 4000; and the fact has suggested the inference
that the figure was reached by artificial computation.</p>

<p><i>The Date of the Exodus.</i>&mdash;Is it possible to determine this,
even approximately, upon the basis of external data? (i.) The
correspondence between the Egyptian governors established
in different parts of Palestine and the Egyptian kings Amen-hôtep
(Amenophis) III. and IV. of the 18th dynasty, which
was discovered in 1887 at Tel el-Amarna, makes it evident
that Palestine could not yet have been in the occupation of the
Israelites. It was still an Egyptian province, and the Babylonian
language, in which the correspondence is written, shows
that the country must have been for a considerable time past,
before it came into the possession of Egypt, under Babylonian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page867" id="page867"></a>867</span>
influence. Now one of the kings, who corresponds with Amen-hotep
<b>IV</b>., is Burnaburiash (Burna-buryas), king of Babylon,
and Egyptologists and Assyriologists are agreed that the date
of these monarchs was <i>c.</i> 1400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The conquest of Canaan,
consequently, could not have taken place till after 1400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
(ii.) It is stated in Ex. i. 11 that the Israelites built in Egypt
for the Pharaoh two store-cities, Pithom and Rameses. The
excavations of M. Naville have, however, shown that Ramses II.
of the 19th dynasty was the builder of Pithom; and though
the other city has not at present been certainly identified, its
name is sufficient to show that he was its builder likewise. Hence
the Pharaoh of the Exodus is commonly supposed to have been
Ramses (Rameses) II.&rsquo;s successor, Merenptah (Mineptah).
Egyptian chronology is unfortunately imperfect; but Professor
Petrie, who has paid particular attention to the subject, and who
assigns the reign of Amen-hotep IV. to 1383-1365 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, assigns
Ramses II. to 1300-1234 <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa31a" id="fa31a" href="#ft31a"><span class="sp">31</span></a> In Merenptah&rsquo;s fifth year the Delta
was invaded by a formidable body of Libyans and other foes;<a name="fa32a" id="fa32a" href="#ft32a"><span class="sp">32</span></a> and
it has been conjectured that the Israelites took the opportunity
of escaping during the unsettlement that was thus occasioned.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Alternative dates for Ramses II.: Maspero, <i>The Struggle of
the Nations</i> (1897), p. 449, <i>c.</i> 1320-1255; Breasted (1906),
1292-1225; Meyer (1909), 1310-1244. Attempts have been made to
identify the Khabiri, who are mentioned often in the Tel el-Amarna
letters as foes, threatening to invade Palestine and bring the Egyptian
supremacy over it to an end, with the Hebrews. The Exodus, it
has been pointed out, might then be placed under Amen-hotep II.
(1448-1420 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, Breasted; 1449-1423, Petrie), the successor of
Thothmes, and more time would be allowed for the events between
the Exodus and the time of David (<i>c.</i> 1000), which, if the date given
above be correct, have been thought to be unduly compressed (see
Orr in the <i>Expositor</i>, March 1897, p. 161 ff.); but there are
difficulties attaching to this view, and it has not been adopted
generally by scholars. There may be some ultimate connexion between
the Khabiri and the Hebrews; but the Khabiri of the Tel el-Amarna
letters cannot be the Hebrews who invaded Canaan under Joshua.</p>
</div>

<p>The mention of Israel on the stele of Merenptah, discovered by
Petrie in 1896 (&ldquo;Israel [Ysirael] is desolated; its seed [<i>or</i>
fruit] is not&rdquo;), is too vague and indefinite in its terms to throw
any light on the question of the Exodus. The context speaks
of places in or near Canaan; and it is possible that the reference
is to Israelite clans who either had not gone down into Egypt at
all, or had already found their way back to Palestine. See
Hogarth&rsquo;s <i>Authority and Archaeology</i>, pp. 62-65.</p>

<p>2. <i>From the Exodus to the Foundation of the Temple</i> (<i>in the
fourth year of Solomon</i>, 1 Kings vi. 1).&mdash;In the chronological note,
1 Kings vi. 1, this period is stated to have consisted of 480
(LXX. 440) years. Is this figure correct? If the years of the
several periods of oppression and independence mentioned
in the Book of Judges (Judges iii. 8, 11, 14, 30, iv. 3, v. 31,
vi. 1, viii. 28, ix. 22, x. 2, 3, 8, xii. 7, 9, 11, 14, xiii. 1,
xv. 20, xvi. 31) be added up, they will be found to amount to
410 years; to these must be added further, in order to gain the
entire period from the Exodus to the foundation of the Temple,
the 40 years in the wilderness, x years under Joshua and the
elders (Judges ii. 7), the 40 (LXX. 20) years&rsquo; judgeship of Eli
(1 Sam. iv. 18), the 20 or more years of Samuel (1 Sam. vii. 2, 15),
the y years of Saul (the two years of 1 Sam. xiii. 1 [R.V.]
seem too few), the 40 years of David (1 Kings ii. 11), and the
first four years of Solomon, <i>i.e.</i> 144 + x + y years, in all 554 years,
+ two unknown periods denoted by x and y&mdash;in any case considerably
more than the 480 years of 1 Kings vi. 1. This period
might no doubt be reduced to 480 years by the supposition, in
itself not improbable, that some of the judges were local and
contemporaneous; the suggestion has also been made that,
as is usual in Oriental chronologies, the years of foreign domination
were not counted, the beginning of each judge&rsquo;s rule being
reckoned, not from the victory which brought him into power, but
from the death of his predecessor; we should in this case
obtain for the period from the Exodus to the foundation of the
Temple 440 + x + y years,<a name="fa33a" id="fa33a" href="#ft33a"><span class="sp">33</span></a> which if 30 years be assigned
conjecturally to Joshua and the elders, and 10 years to Saul, would
amount exactly to 480 years. The terms used, however (&ldquo;and the land
<i>had rest</i> forty years,&rdquo; iii. 11, similarly, iii. 30, v. 31,
viii. 28), seem hardly to admit of the latter supposition; and
even if they did, it would still be scarcely possible to maintain
the correctness of the 480 years: it is difficult to harmonize
with what, as we have seen, appears to be the most probable date
of the Exodus; it is, moreover, open itself to the suspicion of
having been formed artificially, upon the assumption that the period
in question consisted of twelve generations,<a name="fa34a" id="fa34a" href="#ft34a"><span class="sp">34</span></a> of 40 years each.
In the years assigned to the different judges, also, the frequency
of the number 40 (which certainly appears to have been regarded
by the Hebrews as a round number) is suspicious. On the whole
no certain chronology of this period is at present attainable.<a name="fa35a" id="fa35a" href="#ft35a"><span class="sp">35</span></a></p>

<p>3. <i>From the Fourth Year of Solomon to the Captivity of
Judah.</i>&mdash;During this period the dates are both more abundant, and
also, approximately, far more nearly correct, than in any of the
earlier periods; nevertheless in details there is still much
uncertainty and difficulty. The Books of Kings are a compilation
made at about the beginning of the Exile, and one object of the
compiler was to give a consecutive and complete chronology
of the period embraced in his work. With this purpose in view,
he not only notes carefully the length of the reign of each king
in both kingdoms, but also (as long as the northern kingdom
existed) brings the history of the two kingdoms into relation
with one another by equating the commencement of each reign
in either kingdom with the year of the reign of the contemporary
king in the other kingdom.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The following are examples of the standing formulae used by the
compiler for the purpose:&mdash;&ldquo;In the twentieth year of Jeroboam
king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah. And forty and one
years reigned he in Jerusalem&rdquo; (1 Kings xv. 9, 10). &ldquo;In the third
year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign
over all Israel in Tirzah (and reigned) twenty and four years&rdquo;
(<i>ibid.</i> ver. 33).</p>
</div>

<p>In these chronological notices the lengths of the reigns were
derived, there is every reason to suppose, either from tradition or
from the state annals&mdash;the &ldquo;book of the chronicles of Israel&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;Judah&rdquo;), so constantly referred to by the compiler as his
authority (<i>e.g.</i> 1 Kings xv. 23, 31, xvi. 5); but the
&ldquo;synchronisms&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the corresponding dates in the contemporary
reigns in the other kingdom were derived, it is practically
certain, by computation from the lengths of the successive
reigns. Now in some cases, perhaps, in the lengths of the reigns
themselves, in other cases in the computations based upon them,
errors have crept in, which have vitiated more or less the entire
chronology of the period. The existence of these errors can be
demonstrated in two ways: (1) The chronology of the two
kingdoms is not consistent with itself; (2) the dates of various
events in the history, which are mentioned also in the Assyrian
inscriptions, are in serious disagreement with the dates as fixed
by the contemporary Assyrian chronology.</p>

<p>(1) That the chronology of the two kingdoms is inconsistent
with itself is readily shown. After the division of the kingdom
the first year of Jeroboam in Israel coincides, of course, with the
first year of Rehoboam in Judah; and after the death of Jehoram
of Israel and Ahaziah of Judah in battle with Jehu (2 Kings
ix. 24, 27), the first year of Jehu in Israel coincides similarly with
the first year of Athaliah in Judah; there are thus in the history
of the two kingdoms two fixed and certain synchronisms. Now,
if the regnal years of the kings of Israel from Jeroboam to Jehoram
be added together, they will be found to amount to 98, while if
those of the kings of Judah for the same period (viz. from
Rehoboam to Ahaziah) be added together, they amount only
to 95. This discrepancy, if it stood alone, would not, however,
be serious. But when we proceed to add up similarly the
regnal years in the two kingdoms from the division after Solomon&rsquo;s
death to the fall of Samaria in the sixth year of Hezekiah (2 Kings
xviii. 10), we find in the southern kingdom 260 years, and in
the northern kingdom only 241 years 7 months. This is a formidable
discrepancy. Ussher, in order to remove it, has recourse
to the doubtful expedient of artificially lengthening the
northern series of years, by assuming (without any authority in
the text) an &ldquo;interregnum of 11 years&rdquo; after the death of
Jeroboam II., and an &ldquo;anarchy for some years&rdquo; between
Pekah and Hoshea (see the margin of A.V. at 2 Kings xiv. 29;
xv. 8, 29).</p>

<p class="pt2">(2) As we now know, the methods of chronological computation
adopted by the Assyrians were particularly exact. Every
year a special officer was appointed, who held office for that

<p>Manifestly all the Biblical dates earlier than 733-732 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
are too high, and must be considerably reduced: the two events,
also, in Hezekiah&rsquo;s reign&mdash;the fall of Samaria and the invasion
of Sennacherib&mdash;which the compiler of the book of Kings treats
as separated by an interval of <i>eight</i> years, were separated in
reality by an interval of <i>twenty-one</i> years.<a name="fa52a" id="fa52a" href="#ft52a"><span class="sp">52</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page872" id="page872"></a>872</span></p>

<p>Much has been written on the chronology of the kings and
many endeavours have been made to readjust the Biblical
figures so as to bring them into consistency with themselves and
at the same time into conformity with the Assyrian dates. But,
though the fact of there being errors in the Biblical figures is
patent, it is not equally clear at what points the error lies, or how
the available years ought to be redistributed between the various
reigns. It is in any case evident that the accession of Jehu and
Athaliah must be brought down from 884 to 842 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; and this
will involve, naturally, a corresponding reduction of the dates of
the previous kings of both kingdoms, and of course, at the same
time, of those of Solomon, David and Saul. The difficulty is,
however, greatest in the 8th century. Here, in Judah, from the
accession of Athaliah to the accession of Ahaz, tradition gives
143 years, whereas, in fact, there were but 106 years (842-736);
and in Israel, from the death of Menahem to the fall of Samaria,
it gives 31 years, whereas from 738 (assuming that Menahem
died in that year) to 722 there are actually only 16 years. The
years assigned by tradition to the reigns in both kingdoms in the
middle part of the 8th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> have thus to be materially
reduced. But in the following period, from the fall of Samaria in
722 to the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans in 586, the
Biblical dates, so far as we can judge, are substantially correct.
(See further the table above.)</p>

<p>4. <i>From the Destruction of Jerusalem in 586 to the close of the
Old Testament History.</i>&mdash;Here, though it is true that there are
events in the Biblical history which are not fully or unambiguously
dated, there is otherwise no difficulty. The lengths of the
reigns of Nebuchadrezzar and his successors on the throne of
Babylon, and also, after the conquest of Babylon, of Cyrus and
the following Persian kings, are known from the &ldquo;Canon of
Ptolemy,&rdquo; referred to above, the particulars in which, for the
earlier part of this period, are also confirmed by the testimony of
the monuments.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">(B) New Testament.</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Canon.</i></p>

<p>The New Testament is the collection of the Sacred Books of
Christians. It forms in the Bible the distinctive possession of
Christians, just as the Old Testament is the collection of Sacred
Books which Christians share with Jews. Every term in the
definition is significant and has a history. There are, first, the
Books; then, the Collection; then, the Sacred Volume, complete
as such in idea, though not as yet complete in its actual contents;
and, lastly, the Sacred Volume in its full dimensions, as
it has come down to us.</p>

<p>There is a double development, of quality and of quantity; of
quality, as to the estimate formed of the books, their increasing
recognition as sacred; and of quantity, by which the books so
recognized were gradually brought up to their present number.
Our duty will be to describe this double process, and we shall do
so under the four heads: (&alpha;) The Growth of a specifically
Christian Literature; (&beta;) The Collection of the Books into a
single volume, made up of ordered groups; (&gamma;) The investing of
this volume with the character of a Sacred Book; and (&delta;) The
gradual settlement by which the volume assumed its present
dimensions, neither less nor more.</p>

<p>The model throughout was the Old Testament. The result
was attained when there was a definite volume called the New
Testament by the side of the earlier volume called the Old
Testament, complete like it, and like it endowed with the
attributes of a Sacred Book. This is the consummation towards
which events had been steadily moving&mdash;not at first consciously,
for it was some time before the tendencies at work were consciously
realized&mdash;but ending at last in the complete equation of
Old Testament and New, and in the bracketing together of both
as the first and second volumes of a single Bible. This is the
process that we shall have to describe. And because the process
before us is the gradual assimilation of New Testament and Old
Testament, we shall have to include at each step all that
bears upon this. For instance, at starting, it will not be
enough for us simply to tell the story how the Books of the
New Testament came to be written, but we shall have to point
out what there was about them which fitted them to be what
they afterwards became, what inherent qualities they possessed
which suggested the estimate ultimately put upon them; in
others words, how they came to be not only a collection of
Christian books, but a collection of Christian sacred books, or
part of a Bible.</p>

<p>(&alpha;) <i>The Growth of a Christian Literature.</i> 1. <i>The Pauline
Epistles.</i>&mdash;The Bible of Jesus and His disciples was the Old
Testament. And both Jesus and His disciples were to all
appearance content with this. It was probably two full decades
after the death of Christ before there were any specifically
Christian writings at all. The first generation of Christians was
not given to writing. There was not only no obvious reason why
it should write, but there was a positive reason why it should not
write. This reason lay in the dominant attitude of Christians,
which was what we call &ldquo;eschatological.&rdquo; The first generation
of Christians lived in the daily expectation that Christ would
return from heaven. The truth is, that not only were Christians
expecting (as we say) the Second Coming of the Messiah, but
what they expected was <i>the</i> Coming. The Messiah, as all Jews
conceived of Him, was a superhuman being; and His First
Coming as a man among men did not count as really Messianic.
The whole first generation of Christians looked intently for His
Coming in power and great glory, which they believed to be near
at hand. In such a state of mind as this there was no motive for
seeking permanence by writing. Men who imagined that they
might at any moment be caught up to meet the Lord in the air
were not likely to take steps for the instruction of the generations
that might come after them.</p>

<p>Hence the first Christian writings were no deliberate product
of theologians who supposed themselves to be laying the foundation
of a sacred volume. They were not an outcome of the
dominant tendencies of the time, but they arose rather in spite of
them, in the simplest way, just from the practical needs of the
moment.</p>

<p>It was thus that St Paul came to write his two epistles to the
Thessalonians, the oldest Christian documents that we possess.
By this time he was launched on his missionary labours; he
had founded a number of churches, and he was going on to found
others. And these earliest epistles are just the substitute for his
personal presence, advice which he took occasion to send to his
converts after he had left them. There are a few indications that
he had sent similar communications to other churches before, but
these have not been preserved. Indeed the wonder is&mdash;and it is a
testimony to the strength of the impression which St Paul left
upon all with whom he came into contact&mdash;that these missionary
letters of his should have begun to be preserved so soon.</p>

<p>Both Epistles to the Thessalonians have for their object to
calm somewhat the excited expectations of which we have spoken.</p>

<p>The first Epistle hits exactly the prominent features in the
situation, when it reminds the Thessalonians how they had
&ldquo;turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God,
and to wait for his Son from heaven,&rdquo; who would deliver them
from the wrath to come (1 Thess. i. 9, 10). The turning from
idols was of course peculiar to the Gentile communities, but the
waiting for the Messiah from heaven was common to all
Christians, whatever their origin. In this we may take the
epistle as typical of the state of the whole Church at the time.
And there is another important passage which shows why, in
spite of its natural and occasional character, the epistle exhibits
the germs of that essential quality which caused all the books
of the New Testament to be so highly estimated. The apostle
again reminds his readers how they had received his preaching
&ldquo;not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of
God,&rdquo; which showed its power by the way in which it took hold
of those who believed in it (1 Thess. ii. 13). The reference is of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page873" id="page873"></a>873</span>
course primarily to the spoken word, but the written word had
the same qualities as the spoken. It was the deep impression
made by these which prepared Christians generally to accept
the apostolic writings as inspired, and therefore sacred. There
is no greater mistake than to suppose that the estimate formed
by the early Church of its Bible was a merely arbitrary verdict
imposed by an external authority; it was the expression, and
the natural expression (though following certain prescribed
lines), of its real sense of the value and fundamentally divine
origin of the writings which it treasured.</p>

<p>Nearest in character to the Thessalonian Epistles are the
two to Corinth, which have perhaps an interval of a year and
a half between them. When 1 Corinthians was written, the
attitude of the Church was still strongly eschatological (1 Cor.
i. 7, 8, iii. 13-15, vii. 26, 29-31, xv. 25, 26, 51-54, xvi. 23). The
thoughts of men were still set upon the near approach of the end,
the troublous times that would issue in the break-up of the
existing order and the return of Christ to introduce a new era.
There was no idea of constructing a systematic theology;
Christ was still the Jewish Messiah, and His Coming was
conceived of as the Jews conceived of the coming of the Messiah,
as a great supernatural event transforming the face of things
and inaugurating the reign of God. In view of this approaching
revolution, both the Church and the world were regarded as
living from hand to mouth. It was useless to attempt to found
permanent institutions; everything was provisional and for
the moment. And yet, even under these conditions, some
practical arrangements had to be made. The epistle is taken
up with matters of this kind; either the apostle is reproving
disorders and abuses actually existing in the Church, and
almost sure to exist in a young community that had just adopted
a novel method of life and had as yet no settled understanding
of the principles involved in it; or else he is replying to definite
questions put to him by his converts. In all this the epistle is
still a genuine letter, and not a treatise. It only rises from
time to time above the level of a letter, through the extraordinary
penetration, force, enthusiasm and elevation of feeling that the
apostle throws into his treatment of more or less ordinary topics.
He can never rest until he has carried up the question of the
moment to some higher ground of faith or conduct. It is in
this incidental and digressive way that we get the description
of the Gospel in i. 18-ii. 16; of the Christian ministry in chs.
iii., iv.; of the principle of consideration for others in ch. ix.;
of the Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper in chs. x., xi.; of Christian
love in ch. xiii.; of the Resurrection and its consequences in ch. xv.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians is even more a product of the situation: it is
even more taken up with personal relations. No epistle sheds
more light on St Paul&rsquo;s character as a man&mdash;so mobile, so tactful,
so tender and affectionate, and yet so statesmanlike and so
commanding. If doctrinal utterances occur from time to time,
they are in every case incidental and unpremeditated.</p>

<p>The development of doctrine in St Paul&rsquo;s epistles is due in part
to the gradual subsiding of the eschatological temper, but even
more to the growth of controversy. A crisis had arisen in Galatia
owing to the invasion of the churches, which St Paul had founded
there, by reactionary Jews. This called forth a letter<a name="fa53a" id="fa53a" href="#ft53a"><span class="sp">53</span></a> from
St Paul, who felt himself compelled to grapple at close quarters
with teaching which he saw cut at the very root of his own.
He was thus led both to clear up for himself and to state for
the sake of others his whole conception of soteriology&mdash;his
answer to the question how was man to be set right before God.
That was a large part, and at the moment the most crucial part,
of the whole problem of religion.</p>

<p>Two or three years later (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 55-56) St Paul was bent on
paying a visit to Rome. He was not going there straight, but
to Jerusalem first. He knew that he could only do this at the
imminent peril of his life. It seemed very doubtful whether he
would accomplish his desire. And therefore he took the
opportunity to send to the Romans what is really a summing up,
not of the whole of Christianity, but of that side of Christianity
which the preceding controversy had brought into special relief.
He states his case as part of a larger question still&mdash;a question
that inevitably became pressing at that particular time&mdash;as to
the entire religious relation of Jew and Gentile.</p>

<p>These years of shock and conflict could not fail to have marked
effect upon the shaping of definite Christian doctrine. They
drew attention away from the future to the present, and to the
past as leading up to the present. They compelled a man like
St Paul to theorize: thought was driven inward; it was made
to search for foundations, to organize itself and knit together
part with part. And the impulse thus given continued. It
showed itself strongly in the epistles of the next group, especially
Ephesians and Colossians. These epistles took their form at
once from a natural progression of thought and from a new
phase of controversy, a sort of Gnosticizing theory, or theories,
which perverted Christian practice and impaired the supremacy
of Christ by placing other beings or entities by His side. The
apostle meets this by renewed emphasis on the central position
of Christ; and he at the same time carries a step farther his
conception of the unity of the Church, as embracing both Jew
and Gentile. The predominance of this somewhat recondite
teaching gave to these epistles even more the character of
treatises, which in the case of Ephesians is further enhanced
by the fact that it is probably a circular letter addressed not to
a single church but to a group of churches. Philemon is of course
a pure letter, and Philippians mainly so, the Pastorals, as their
name implies, contain advice and instructions to the apostle&rsquo;s
lieutenants, Timothy and Titus, in the temporary charge committed
to them of churches that the apostle could not visit himself.</p>

<p>The Epistle to the Hebrews is an epistolary treatise of uncertain
date, on the Pauline model, and by a disciple of St Paul or at
least a writer strongly influenced by him, though influenced
also in no small degree by the Jewish school of Alexandria
represented by Philo. Of the many theories as to the address, the
most plausible are perhaps those which would apply to a single
congregation of Hebrew Christians in Rome, or to a local church
or group of local churches in Palestine, perhaps like that of
which the centre would be at Caesarea. It is not probable
that the epistle was addressed to the mother church at Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The above sketch of the growth and general character of the
Pauline Epistles is based upon the hypothesis that all thirteen
are genuine. But some discrimination should be made in detail.
The scepticism which challenges the whole collection may be set
aside as radically perverse and unreasonable. Apart from this, the
keen criticism of modern times has fastened especially upon two
groups:&mdash;2 Thessalonians; Colossians with Philemon, Ephesians and
the Pastorals. The present writer would accept without any real
hesitation the first of these classes; and the second he would also
himself accept, though in regard to this class he would think it
right to speak with rather more reserve. This may be said to be the
position generally taken up by the leading English scholars; it
differs slightly in a conservative direction, but not widely, from
that of Harnack, a little more from that of Jülicher, and again a
little more from that of von Soden.</p>

<p>2 Thessalonians is still questioned by scholars of some note; but
when Jülicher can say that no question could be raised if it were not
for the existence of 1 Thessalonians (assumed to be genuine), this
is practically giving up the whole case, because the objections drawn
from 1 Thessalonians are, at least to the present writer, only an
example of faulty criticism. Still less is there any valid argument
against Philemon. It is a mark of the improved methods now current
in Germany that, whereas in 1886 this epistle was rejected by a
scholar as able and sober as Weizsäcker, Jülicher now pronounces
it &ldquo;among the most assured possessions of the apostle&rdquo; (<i>Einl.</i>
5th ed., p. 112).</p>

<p>But there is an arguable case of some real weight against Colossians,
Ephesians, Pastorals&mdash;least against Colossians and perhaps
most against the Pastorals. Colossians is strongly vouched for by
its connexion with Philemon. And the objections to Ephesians
are considerably reduced when it is taken as a circular letter. But
it should be admitted that, especially in regard to Ephesians and
Pastorals, there is a perceptible difference, (<i>a</i>) in style, and (<i>b</i>) in
characteristic subject matter, from the standard epistles. If these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page874" id="page874"></a>874</span>
later epistles are really the work of St Paul, the difference must be
accounted for (<i>a</i>) by a somewhat unusual range of variation in style
and thought on his part, and (<i>b</i>) by different environment and
different purpose. The question is whether these explanations are
adequate. The writer of this is inclined to think that they are.
St Paul was in any case an unusual writer, by no means facile or
with ready command of expression; still, he could by an effort express
what he wanted, and new situations called up new words and new
minor ideas. He was also a writer in whom the physical wear and
tear must have been enormous. It might well be believed that the
change in the so-called Epistles of the Imprisonment from the
earlier epistles was due in part to the physical effects of prolonged
confinement, as compared with the free, varied and open life and
exciting controversies of earlier years. There is also the uncertain
element that may possibly be due to the use of different amanuenses.
An argument in favour of the genuineness of the epistles may be
derived from the fact that each of the doubtful epistles is connected
with others that are not doubtful by subtle links both of style and
thought. If the reasons suggested above are not adequate, then
we must set down the questioned epistles to some disciple of St Paul,
who has carried the ideas and principles of his master a step farther
or has applied them to a different set of problems and conditions.</p>
</div>

<p>2. <i>The Gospels and Acts.</i>&mdash;The Gospels and Acts arose in a
way very similar to the Pauline Epistles. Here too there was no
deliberate intention of writing a series of books that should be
at once accepted as sacred and authoritative. Here too the
expectation of the near return of Christ doubtless delayed for
a number of years the desire and need for written compositions.
Here too the first steps were taken as the exigencies of the
moment dictated. We are again driven to fill up the gaps in
our knowledge by conjectures; but some such outline as the
following has much to commend it.</p>

<p>When the enterprise of Christian missionaries had gone on for
some little time, especially in the regions outside Palestine
where there was little or no previous knowledge of Christ and of
Christian ideals, the wandering prophets and apostles by whom
the missions were mainly conducted must have soon begun to
feel the need for some sort of written manual to supplement
their own personal teaching. It was one of the characteristics
of the early Christian teachers that they rarely stayed for any
length of time in a place; they moved on, and the little
congregation was left to wait for another visitor, who might
be some time in coming. How was this interval to be filled?
There would be every degree of preparation, or want of
preparation, for the reception of Christian teaching. Some Jews,
like those who are described in the Gospel as &ldquo;waiting for the
kingdom of God,&rdquo; would be pious men and women carefully
trained in the Old Testament, who would be almost fit for the
kingdom even before they had heard of Christ. Other Gentile
converts would require instruction in the very rudiments of
ethical and monotheistic religion. Between these extremes
there would be many shades and degrees of ignorance and
knowledge. How could these various cases be met at once
most simply and most effectually? We remember that the Christian
preachers were preaching before all things a Person, but
a Person whose interest for these new converts lay chiefly in the
fact that He was about to come and establish a supernatural
kingdom for which they had to fit themselves. The best way
therefore of helping them to do this was to provide them with
an outline of the characteristic teaching of Christ, which should
be at the same time a clear statement of His moral demands.
It is probable that these requirements suggested the form of
the first Christian Gospel, which the writer believes to be rightly
identified with the so-called <i>Logia</i> of St Matthew, now often
designated by the symbol Q. It did not aim at being a history,
and still less a complete history, but it was mainly a collection
of sayings or discourses suited to supply a rule of life.</p>

<p>It would be somewhat later than this, and not until the
eschatological outlook became weaker, and men began to turn
their regard to the past rather than to the future, that there
would gradually arise a more strictly historical interest. There
is reason to think that in the Christian Church this interest did
not begin to be active much before the decade <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 60-70.
Its first conspicuous product was our present Gospel of St Mark,
which was probably composed at Rome within the years 64-70.
We say advisedly &ldquo;our present Gospel of St Mark,&rdquo; because
there does not seem to us to be any sufficient reason for
presupposing an <i>Ur-Marcus</i>, or older form of this Gospel.</p>

<p>These two works, the <i>Logia</i> (or, as some prefer to call
it, the Non-Marcan document common to Matthew and Luke) and
the Mark-Gospel, were the prime factors in all the subsequent
composition of Gospels. Our Matthew and our Luke are just
combinations, differently constructed, of these two documents,
with a certain amount of additional matter which the editors
had collected for themselves. And it is probable that other
Gospels of which only fragments have come down to us, like the
Gospel according to the Hebrews and the Gospel of Peter, have
been built up out of the same materials.</p>

<p>St Luke was the first to write, as we may see from his preface,
definitely in the spirit of a historian. He addresses his work
to Theophilus, apparently an official person, who had already
been taught the main outlines of Christianity. He had planned
his work on a large scale; and in Acts we have its second volume.
It is an event of no small importance for criticism
that so eminent a scholar as Prof. Harnack should have come
round to the view, almost universally prevalent in England,
that St Luke himself was the final editor and author of both
the Third Gospel and the Acts. It is a very secondary question
what is their exact date.</p>

<p>The reasons which converge upon the conclusion just
expressed as to the origin and nature of the fundamental
documents worked up in our present Synoptic Gospels are as
follows:&mdash;(i.) The literary analysis of the Synoptic Gospels
brings out a number of sections common to Matthew and Luke
which probably at one time existed as an independent document.
(ii.) This document consisted, in the main though not entirely, of
a collection of Sayings of the Lord, which set in strong relief
at once His character and the moral and religious ideal that He
desired to commend. (iii.) We have an express statement, which
must have been originally made before the end of the first
century, that the apostle Matthew composed in Hebrew a work
described as <i>Logia</i>. This word need not mean, but may quite
well and pointedly mean, a collection specially of Sayings,
and would still more aptly denote a collection of divine or
authoritative sayings (<span class="grk" title="logia">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#953;&#945;</span> = prop. &ldquo;oracles&rdquo;).
(iv.) We know further that the conditions of early Christian
missionary teaching were such as have been described. We learn
this especially from the <i>Didache</i>; and the first part of
that work, the so-called &ldquo;Two-Ways,&rdquo; is commonly thought to have
been in the first instance a Jewish manual put into the hands of
proselytes. On our hypothesis the <i>Logia</i> would have been a
sort of Christian manual used with a similar object. (v.) We
are confirmed in this opinion by the fact that the epistles of
St Paul furnish many indications that Christians in general,
including those who had not been much in contact with the
original Twelve, were well acquainted with the leading features
in the character of Christ and in the Christian ideal, although
there is little corresponding evidence for their knowledge of
details in the life of Christ.</p>

<p>There is a similar statement to the one mentioned above,
that like it must have been originally made before the end
of the first century, as to a Gospel composed by St Mark on the
basis mainly of the preaching of St Peter, though this need not
exclude personal experience (as, <i>e.g.</i>, perhaps in Mark xiv. 51-52)
or information derived from other sources. Only raw materials
came from St Peter, and those probably not checked or revised by
him; the arrangement is due to Mark himself, and is more successful
than might have been expected in the circumstances&mdash;indeed
so successful as to suggest advice from some good quarter.
According to Irenaeus (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 185), who is more precise than
Clement of Alexandria, the Gospel was not published until
after the death of Peter, which would place its composition
between the limits <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 65 and 70. The phenomena which are
sometimes supposed to require the hypothesis of an <i>Ur-Marcus</i>
are more simply and satisfactorily explained as incidents in the
transmission of the Marcan text.</p>

<p>The matter peculiar to Matthew and Luke raises a number
of interesting questions which are still too much <i>sub judice</i> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page875" id="page875"></a>875</span>
be answered decidedly or dogmatically, though approximate
and provisional answers may before long be forthcoming. All
parts of the problem have been greatly forwarded by the recent
publication of important works by Wellhausen and Harnack
(see below). The date of the completed Luke depends (<i>a</i>) on
whether or not we believe Luke himself or a later disciple to be
the author, and (<i>b</i>) whether or not we believe that the author
of Acts had seen Josephus&rsquo; <i>Antiquities</i>, published in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 93 or
94. Professor Burkitt takes an original line in maintaining that
Luke was the author of both works, and yet that he had seen
<i>Antiq</i>. The present writer is inclined to think the latter hypothesis
not proven. The date of Matthew cannot be fixed more
nearly than 70-100.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Catholic Epistles.</i>&mdash;The Catholic Epistles were so
called in the first instance from their wider and more indefinite
address; they were intended for Christians generally, or over
some wide area, rather than for a particular church or individual.
2 and 3 John are exceptions, but probably came in under
the wing of the larger epistle, which is strictly &ldquo;catholic.&rdquo; As
applied to a class of epistles, the title dates from Eusebius, early
in the 4th century; the epithet is given to single epistles by
Origen, and is found as far back as the end of the 2nd century.
In later Latin usage &ldquo;catholic&rdquo; came to mean much the same as
&ldquo;canonical,&rdquo; another name that was also given.</p>

<p>This group of epistles practically continues and supplements
the work of the epistles of St Paul, 1 Peter, if genuine, must date
from the end of the apostle&rsquo;s career (for the early composition
claimed for it by B. Weiss is a paradox that may be disregarded).
It was written to instruct and encourage the Christians of Asia
Minor at a time of persecution, which on the hypothesis of
genuineness, would be the Neronian, <i>i.e</i>. a secondary outbreak
perhaps loosely connected with the onslaught in Rome. The
Epistle of James (also, if genuine) must be placed late in the lifetime
of the brother of the Lord. In that case it was probably not
written with any direct polemic against writings of St Paul, but
against hearsay versions of his teaching that had reached
Jerusalem. Controversy of this kind is not always conducted
with complete understanding of that which is being opposed.
The Epistle of Jude cannot be either dated or localized with any
certainty. It seems on the whole most probable that 2 Peter is
not a genuine work, but that it came from the same factory of
pseudonymous Petrine writings as the Apocalypse which bears
the same name, though the one has, and the other has not,
obtained a place within the Canon. This epistle was questioned
from the first, and only gained its place with much hesitation,
and rather through slackness of opposition than any conclusiveness
of proof. The three Johannine epistles may be more
conveniently treated under the next head.</p>

<p>Even in the case of the two more important epistles, 1 Peter
and James, we have to add the qualification &ldquo;if genuine,&rdquo; but
rather perhaps because of the persistence with which they are
challenged than because of inherent defect of attestation. The
evidence for 1 Peter is both early in date and wide in range, and
the book was one of those that passed as &ldquo;acknowledged&rdquo; in
antiquity. The evidence for James is not so widely diffused but
is found in early writings. Perhaps the position of these two
epistles might be described as not unlike that of Colossians and
Ephesians. Instead of casting doubt upon them, we should
prefer to say that they are both probably genuine, but that there
are features about them that are not as yet fully explained.
The chief of these features is their relation to the writings of St
Paul. There is indeed so much that is Pauline in 1 Peter as to
give distinct attractiveness to the hypothesis, which is most
elaborately maintained by Zahn, that a larger share than usual
in the composition of the letter was left to Silvanus (1 Peter
v. 12). Nor does it appear to us that the objections to this theory
brought by Dr Chase in his excellent article on the epistle in
Hastings&rsquo; <i>Dictionary</i> are really so fatal as he supposes. The
epistle is more the work of a companion of St Paul of long
standing than of one who, with quite different and independent
antecedents, had only been influenced by the perusal of one or
two of St Paul&rsquo;s letters. In the Epistle of James we have a
really distinct type; and it seems to us that the degree to which
the epistle misses its mark as a polemic may be easily and
naturally accounted for in more ways than one.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Johannine Writings</i>.&mdash;The Gospel and Epistles that
bear the name of John, and the Apocalypse, form a group of
writings that stand very much by themselves and are still the
subject of active discussion. The points in regard to them that
would unite the greatest number of suffrages would seem to be
these:&mdash;(i.) That, except 2 Peter, they are probably the latest of
the New Testament writings, and that they form a group closely
connected among themselves, though it is not clear how many
hands have been at work in them, (ii.) That they arose not far
from each other towards the end of the 1st century. The
Apocalypse is plausibly dated by Reinach and Harnack near to
the precise year 93, and the other writings may be referred to
the reign of Domitian (81-96), though many critics would extend
the limit to some two decades later, (iii.) The writings are to be
connected, either more or less closely, with John of Ephesus, who
was a prominent figure towards the end of the 1st century. On
the other hand, the greatest differences would be:&mdash;(i.) As to the
personal identity of this John&mdash;is he himself &ldquo;the beloved
disciple&rdquo;? Is he the apostle, the son of Zebedee or another?
Can the writer of the Apocalypse be the same as the writer of the
Gospel and Epistles? (ii.) What is the exact relation of John
of Ephesus to the Gospel? Is he its author or only the authority
behind it? (iii.) How far is the Gospel intended to be, and how
far is it, in the strict sense historical? This last question is
beginning to overshadow all the rest.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the ultimate decision on these intricate
questions, the Fourth Gospel in any case played a very important
part in the history of the Church and of Christian theology. It
drew together and gathered up into itself the forces at work in the
apostolic age; and, by reaching out a hand as it were (through
the preface) towards Greek philosophy, it succeeded in so
formulating the leading doctrines of Christianity as to make it
more acceptable than it had as yet been to the Gentile world,
and in securing for the Gospel a place in the main stream of
European thought. It is probably true to say that no other
primitive Christian writing has had so marked an effect on all
later attempts to systematize the Christian creed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The situation as to the Fourth Gospel has been altered in recent
years by the statement attributed to Papias that the two sons of
Zebedee (and not only one) were slain by the Jews&mdash;a statement
which becomes more difficult to put aside as the evidence for it
increases (full details in Burkitt, <i>Gosp. Hist</i>. pp. 252-255; E.
Schwartz, <i>Über d. Tod d. Söhne Zebedaci</i>, Berlin, 1904). But this
statement does not affect the historical character of John of Ephesus,
who is also expressly described by Papias as &ldquo;a disciple of the
Lord&rdquo; (Eus. <i>H.E</i>. iii. 39. 4). On the other hand, the theory that
the Gospel is a thorough-going allegory must be hard to maintain
in view of the frequent appeals to &ldquo;witness&rdquo; which is several times
denned as eye-witness (John i. 15, 32, iii. 11, xix. 35, xxi. 24; 1 John
i. 1-3; cf. John v. 36, x. 25). This is borne out by Ignatius with
his strong emphasis on the reality of the Gospel history (<i>Eph</i>. xx.
2; <i>Trall</i>, x.; <i>Smyrn</i>. i. 1, 2, ii., iii. 1-3, v. 2). If the writer of the
Gospel were simply inventing his facts, they would be no proof of his
thesis (John xx. 31). It is a paradox that he should be invoked
&ldquo;to prove the reality of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (as against Docetism), and
yet that it should be contended at the same time that for him
&ldquo;ideas, and not events, were the true realities.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>5. <i>Other Literature not included in the New Testament.</i>&mdash;It
must not be thought that the primitive Christian literature
came abruptly to an end with the writings that are included in
our present New Testament. On the contrary, all round these
there was a broad fringe of writings more or less approximating
to them in character. Most nearly on the lines of the New
Testament are the so-called Apostolic (really Sub-Apostolic)
Fathers (Clement of Rome to the Corinthians, <i>Didach&#275;</i>, Barnabas,
the letters of Ignatius and the single letter of Polycarp, the
<i>Shepherd</i> of Hermas, the homily commonly known as the Second
Epistle of Clement). These are in most cases the writings of
leading persons in the Church who took up and continued the
tradition of the apostles. Barnabas and 2 Clement are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page876" id="page876"></a>876</span>
eccentric, but the writers must have been persons of some note.
Outside this group would come what are called the Apocryphal
Gospels and Acts (Gospel according to Hebrews, according to
Egyptians, of Peter, of Truth, of the Twelve [or Ebionite Gospel],
the recently recovered so-called <i>Logia</i>; the Gospel of Nicodemus,
the Protevangelium of James, the Gospel of Thomas, the Acts
of Pilate, Acts of Paul, Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas; the
Preaching of Peter, the Apocalypse of Peter). As the 2nd century
wears on, we come to controversial or philosophical works by
Agrippa, Castor, Quadratus, Aristides. With the middle of the
century we reach a considerable writer in Justin Martyr. With
him the twilight period which succeeds to the apostolic age is
over, and we enter upon the main course of ecclesiastical history.
At this point, therefore, our survey may end.</p>

<p>(&beta;) <i>The Process of Discrimination and Collection</i>, 1. <i>Discrimination.</i>&mdash;Throughout
the apostolic age Christians were
conscious of being carried forward in a great movement, the
origin and motive-power of which they regarded as supernatural.
It began on the Day of Pentecost, but continued in full tide
almost to the end of the 1st century, and, even when it began
to subside, it did so quite gradually. The moment of transition
is clearly marked in the <i>Didach&#275;</i>, where the <i>charismatic</i> ministry
of &ldquo;apostles and prophets&rdquo; is beginning to give place to permanent
local officials of the Church, bishops, presbyters and
deacons. The literature that we now call the New Testament
held its place because it was regarded as a product of the palmy
days of that great movement. It was considered to be the work
of inspired men, of men whom the Holy Spirit, at that time
specially active in the Church, had chosen as its organs. We
have seen how St Paul, for instance, fully believed that his own
preaching had a force behind it which vindicated for it the claim
to be &ldquo;the word of God&rdquo; (1 Thess. ii. 13); and it was inevitable
that the other preachers and teachers should have had in different
degrees something of the same consciousness. This consciousness
receives perhaps its strongest expression in the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>There is really no contradiction between this sense of a high
calling and mission, with a special endowment corresponding
to it, and the other fact that the writings from this age that
have come down to us are all (except perhaps the Apocalypse,
and even the Apocalypse, in some degree, as we see by the letters
to the Seven Churches) strictly occasional and natural in their
origin. The lives and actions of apostles and prophets were in
their general tenor like those of other men; it was only that,
for the particular purpose of their mission, they found themselves
carried beyond and above themselves. St Paul himself
knew when he was speaking by the Spirit, and when he was
not; and we too can recognize to some extent when the
<i>afflatus</i> comes upon him. It is fortunate that this should be so
clearly marked in his epistles, because it enables us to argue
by analogy to the other writers. When we come to historical
books like the third Gospel and the Acts, we find the writer
just pursuing the ordinary methods of history, and not claiming
to do anything more (Luke i. 1-4). With the methods of history,
these writers were naturally exposed to the risks and chances
of error attendant upon those methods. There was hot at first
among the writers any idea that they were composing an infallible
narrative. The freedom with which they used each other&rsquo;s
work, and with which the early texts were transmitted, excludes
this. But there was the idea that the whole movement of the
Church to which they gave expression was in a special sense
divine. And this belief was the fundamental principle that
determined the marking off of the writings of the first, or apostolic,
age from the rest.</p>

<p>At the same time it must not be supposed that a hard and fast
line can be drawn beyond which the spiritual stimulus of this
first age ceased. The writings of Clement of Rome (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 97) and
of Ignatius (<i>c</i>. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 110) mark the transition. Ignatius, for instance,
clearly distinguishes between his own position and that
of the apostles: &ldquo;I do not enjoin you. as Peter and Paul did.
They were Apostles, I am a convict; they were free, but I am a
slave to this very hour&rdquo; (Rom. iv. 3). And yet, none the less,
Ignatius is conscious of acting and speaking at times from a
kind of inspiration. &ldquo;Even though certain persons desired
to deceive me after the flesh, yet the spirit is not deceived, being
from God; for it knoweth whence it cometh and where it goeth,
and it searcheth out the hidden things. I cried out, when I was
among you; I spake with a loud voice, with God&rsquo;s own voice,
give ye heed to the bishops, and the presbyters and deacons&rdquo;
(<i>Philadelph</i>. vii. 1). In like manner Clement, in two places
(lix. 1, lxiii. 2), writes as though God were speaking through him.</p>

<p>2. <i>Collection.</i>&mdash;Concurrently with the tendency to discriminate
between the higher authority of certain writings and the lower
authority of others, there was also a tendency to collect and
group together writings of the first class. The earliest example
of this tendency is in the case of the Pauline Epistles. Marcion,
we know (<i>c</i>. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 140), had a collection of ten out of thirteen,
in the order, Gal., 1 and 2 Cor., Rom., 1 and 2 Thess., Laodic.
(= Eph.), Col., Phil., Philem. We observe that the Pastorals
are omitted. But it is highly probable that the collection went
back a full generation before Marcion. The short Epistle of
Polycarp contains references or allusions to no less than nine
out of the thirteen epistles, including 2 Thess., Eph., 1 and
2 Tim. Ignatius, writing just before, gives clear indications
of six, including 1 Tim. and Titus. The inference lies near
at hand that both writers had access to the full collection of
thirteen, not omitting the Pastorals. Polycarp (<i>ad Phil</i>. xiii. 2)
shows how strong was the interest in collecting the writings of
eminent men.</p>

<p>It of course did not follow that, because the letters of St Paul
were collected, they were therefore regarded as sacred. The
feeling towards them at first would be simply an instinct of
respect and deference; but we have seen above that the essential
conditions of the higher estimate were present all along, and
were only waiting to be recognized as soon as reflective thought
was turned upon them. This process appears to have been
going on throughout the middle years of the 2nd century.</p>

<p>The famous passage of Irenaeus (<i>Adv. Haer</i>. iii. 15. 8) assumes
the possession by the Church of four authoritative Gospels
and no more. This is the general view of the Church of his time,
except the little clique known as the Alogi who rejected the
Fourth Gospel, and Marcion, who only recognized St Luke.
But here again, we may go back some way farther. Irenaeus
writes (<i>c</i>. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 185) as though the Four Gospels had held the
field as far back as he can remember. About <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 170 Tatian,
the disciple of Justin, composed out of these Gospels his <i>Diatessaron</i>.
If Justin used any other Gospel, his use of it was very
subordinate. Practically we may say that the estimate of the
Four to which Tatian and Irenaeus testify must have been well
established by the middle of the century, though sporadic
instances may be found of the use of other Gospels that did not
become canonical. The sifting out of these was proceeding
steadily and gradually, and by the end of the century it may be
regarded as complete.</p>

<p>We must make allowance for the existence of this margin,
and for the blurring of the boundary-line that goes along with
it. We cannot claim for the Church absolute sureness of judgment
as to what falls on one side of the line and what on the other.
It is possible, <i>e.g</i>., that a mistake has been made in the case of
2 Peter, which, however, is edifying enough. It is not less
possible that writings like 1 Clem, and Epp. Ignat. are not
inferior in real religious value to the Epistle of Jude. But,
broadly speaking, the judgment of the early Church has been
endorsed by that of after ages.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Harnack raises an interesting question (<i>Reden u. Aufsätze</i>. ii.
239 ff.), how it came about that Four Gospels were recognized, and
not only one. There are many indications early in the 2nd century
of a tendency towards the recognition of a single Gospel; for instance,
there are the local Gospels according to Hebrews, according
to Egyptians; Marcion had but one Gospel, St Luke, the Valentinians
preferred St John and so on; Tatian reduced the Four
Gospels to one by means of a Harmony, and it is possible that
something of the kind may have existed before he did this. There
is probably some truth in the view that the Church clung to its
Four Gospels as a weapon against Gnosticism; it could not afford
to reduce the number of its documents. But, over and above this,
there was probably something in the circumstances in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page877" id="page877"></a>877</span>
canonical Gospels were composed, and in their early history, which
gave them a special prestige in the eyes of the faithful. The story
which Eusebius quotes from Clement of Alexandria (<i>H.E</i>. vi. 14)
seems to point to something of the kind.</p>
</div>

<p>3. <i>Influences at work.</i>&mdash;The whole process of the formation
of the New Testament was steady and gradual. The critical
period, during which the conception grew up of the New Covenant
with its sacred book by the side of the Old Covenant, which in
its written embodiment we call the Old Testament, extends
roughly over the 2nd century. By the last decades of that
century a preliminary list of these new Sacred Books had been
formed and placed by the side of the Old with substantially the
same attributes. We must briefly sketch the process by which
this came about, tracing the causes which led to the result and
indicating the manner in which they operated.</p>

<p>We have seen that the ultimate cause was the consciousness
on the part of the Church that the first age of its own history
was characterized by spiritual workings more intense than other
times. This feeling had been instinctive, and it found expression
in several ways, each one of them partial, when taken alone,
but obtaining their full effect in combination. It should be
understood that the goal towards which events were moving
all the time was the equalizing of the New Testament with the
Old Testament.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Public Reading.</i>&mdash;From the first the way in which the Epistles
of Paul were brought to the knowledge of the churches to which
they were addressed was by reading in the public assemblies for
worship. This was done by the direction of the apostle himself
(1 Thess. v. 27; Col. iv. 16). At first any writing that was felt to
be useful for edification was read in this way, especially if it had
local associations (cf. Dionysius of Corinth, <i>ap</i>. Eus. <i>H.E</i>. iv. 23.
11). But, as worship became more thoroughly organized, it was
invested with increasing solemnity; the freedom of choice was
gradually restricted; and inasmuch as lections were regularly taken
from the Old Testament, it was only natural that other lections
read alongside of them should gradually be placed upon the same
footing.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Authority of Christ and the Apostles.</i>&mdash;As the words of prophets
and lawgivers had from the first carried their own authority with
them under the Old Covenant, so from the first the words of Christ
needed no commendation from without under the New. And what
applied to words of Christ soon came also to apply in their degree
to words of the apostles. The only difference was that an authority
at first instinctively assumed came to be consciously recognized
and formally defined. There was also a natural tendency towards
levelling up the different parts of books and groups of books. In
other words, the somewhat vague sense of spiritual power and impressiveness
hardened into the conception of sacred books united
in a sacred volume.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Controversy.</i>&mdash;The process was accelerated by the demand for
a standard or rule of faith and practice. At an early date in the
2nd century this demand was met by the composition of the oldest
form of what we call the Apostles&rsquo; Creed. But the Creed was but
the condensed essence of the New Testament scriptures, and behind
it there lay an appeal to these scriptures, which was especially
necessary where (as in the case of the Valentinian Gnostics) the
dissident bodies professed to accept the common belief of Christians.
In its conflict with Gnostics, Marcionites and Montanists the Church
was led to insist more and more upon its Bible, its own Bible, just
as in its older controversy with the Jews it had to insist on the Bible
which it inherited from them. This was a yet further cause of the
equating of the two parts of the sacred volume, which went on with
an imperceptible <i>crescendo</i> through the first three quarters of the
2nd century, and by the last quarter was fairly complete.</p>
</div>

<p>(&gamma;) <i>Provisional Canon of New Testament</i> (end of 2nd century).&mdash;By
the last quarter of the 2nd century the conception of a
Christian Bible in two parts, Old Testament and New Testament,
may be said to be definitely established. Already at the beginning
of this period Melito had drawn up a list of the twenty-two
Books of the Old Covenant, <i>i.e</i>. of the documents to which the
Old Covenant made its appeal. It was a very short step to the
compiling of a similar list for the New Covenant, which by another
very short step becomes the New Testament, by the side of the
Old Testament. It is therefore not surprising, though a piece of
great good fortune, that there should be still extant a list of the
New Testament books that may be roughly dated from the end
of the century. This list published by Muratori in 1740, and
called after him &ldquo;the Muratorian Fragment on the Canon,&rdquo; is
commonly believed to be of Roman origin and to be a translation
from the Greek, though there are a few dissentients on
both heads. The list recognized four Gospels, Acts, thirteen
epistles of Paul, two epistles of John, Jude, Apocalypse of John
and (as the text stands) of Peter; there is no mention of
Hebrews or (apparently) of 3 John or Epistles of Peter, where it
is possible&mdash;we cannot say more&mdash;that the silence as to 1 Peter
is accidental; the <i>Shepherd</i> of Hermas on account of its date
is admitted to private, but not public, reading; various writings
associated with Marcion, Valentinus, Basilides and Montanus
are condemned.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are many interesting points about this list, which still shows
considerable freshness of judgment, (i.) There are traces of earlier
discussions about the Gospels, both in disparagement of the Synoptics
as compared with St John, and in criticism of the latter as differing
from the former, (ii.) There is a healthy tendency to lay stress on
the historical value of narratives which proceed from eye-witnesses,
(iii.) An over-ruling and uniting influence is ascribed to the Holy
Spirit, (iv.) The writer is concerned to point out that letters addressed
to a single church and even to an individual may yet have
a wider use for the Church as a whole, (v.) The sense is not yet lost
that the appeal of the Old Testament is as coming from men of prophetic
gifts, and that of the New Testament as coming from apostles,
(vi.) It is in accordance with this that a time limit is placed upon
the books included in the New Testament, (vii.) Christians are to
be on their guard against writings put forth in the interest of heretical
sects.</p>
</div>

<p>When the data of Fragm. Murat. are compared with those
supplied by the writers of the last quarter of the 2nd and first
of the 3rd centuries (Tatian, Theoph. Ant., Iren., Clem. Alex.,
Tert., Hippol.), it is seen that there is a fixed nucleus of writings
that is acknowledged, with one exception, over all parts of the
Christian world. The exception is the Syriac-speaking Church
of Edessa and Mesopotamia. This Church at first acknowledged
only the Gospel (in the form of Tatian&rsquo;s <i>Diatessaron</i>), Acts and
the Epistles of Paul. These seem to have been the only books
translated immediately upon the foundation of the Edessan
Church, though an edition of the separate Gospels must have
followed either before or very soon afterwards. In all other
churches the four Gospels, Acts and Epistles of Paul are fixed,
with the addition in nearly all of 1 Peter, 1 John. The Apocalypse
was generally accepted in the West. Hebrews and James were
largely accepted in the East.</p>

<p>In the 3rd century the conspicuous figure is Origen (<i>ob</i>. 253),
whose principal service was, through the vast range of his knowledge,
his travels and his respect for tradition wherever he found
it, to keep open the wider limits of the Canon. There is not one
of our present books that he does not show himself inclined to
accept, though he notes the doubts in regard to 2 Peter and
2 and 3 John. Later in the century Dionysius of Alexandria
applies some acute criticism to justify the Alexandrian dislike
of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>(&delta;) <i>The Final Canon</i> (4th century).&mdash;Early in the 4th
century Eusebius, as a historian reviews the situation (<i>H.E</i>. iii.
25. 1). He makes three classes; the first, including the Gospels,
Acts, Epistles of Paul, 1 Peter, 1 John, is acknowledged; to
these, if one likes, one may add the Apocalypse. The second
class is questioned, but accepted by the majority; viz. James,
Jude, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John. The third class, of works
to be decidedly rejected, contains the Acts of Paul, Hermas,
Apocalypse of Peter, Barnabas, <i>Didach&#275;</i>; to these some would
add Apoc. of John, and others <i>Ev. sec. Hebr</i>. About the same
time another line of tradition is represented by Lucian and the
school of Antioch. The vernacular Church of Syria represented
yet a third. In Egypt the uncertainty and laxity of usage was
still greater. This state of things the great Athanasius set
himself to correct, and he did so by laying down a list identical
with our New Testament as we have it now. It was very largely
the influence of Athanasius that finally turned the scale. He
was peculiarly qualified for exercising this influence, as his long
exile in the West made him familiar with Western usage, while
he was also able to bring to the West the usage that he was
trying to establish in the East. His efforts would be helped by
Westerns, like Hilary and Lucifer, who were exiled to the East.
The triumph of the Athanasian Canon, indeed, went along with
the triumph of Nicene Christianity. And while the movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page878" id="page878"></a>878</span>
received its impulse from Athanasius, the power by which it
was carried through and established was largely that of his
powerful ally, the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>The final victory was no doubt a little delayed. Asia Minor
and Syria were for most of the 4th century divided between
the following of Eusebius (Cyril of Jerusalem in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 348, Gregory
of Nazianzus, the list of <i>Apost. Can</i>. 85, that attached to Can. 59
of the Council of Laodicea, <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 363) and the school of Antioch.
The leading members of that school adopted 3 Epp. Cath.
(James, 1 Peter, 1 John), Theod. Mops. omitting this group
altogether, and the whole school omitting Apoc. Amphilochius
of Iconium (<i>c.</i> 380) gives the two lists, Eusebian and Antiochene,
as alternatives. The Eusebian list only wanted the complete
admission of the Apocalypse to be identical with the Athanasian;
and Athanasius had one stalwart supporter in Epiphanius
(<i>ob</i>. 403).</p>

<p>The original Syriac list, as we have seen, had neither Epp.
Cath. nor Apoc. The Peshito version, in regard to which Professor
Burkitt&rsquo;s view is now pretty generally accepted, that it was the
work of Rabbula, bishop of Edessa, 411-433, added the 3 Epp.
Cath. The remaining 4 Epp. Cath. and Apoc. were supplied
in the Philoxenian version of 508, and retained in the
Harklean revision of 616. But both these were Monophysite
and of limited use, and the Nestorians still went on using the
Peshito.</p>

<p>Meantime, in the West, an important Synod was held by
Damasus at Rome in 382 which, under the dominant influence
of Jerome and the Athanasian tradition, drew up a list corresponding
to the present Canon. This was ratified by Pope Gelasius
(492-496), and independently confirmed for the province of
Africa by a series of Synods held at Hippo Regius in 393, and at
Carthage in 397 and 419, under the lead of Augustine. The
formal completion of the whole process in East and West was
reserved for the Quinisextine Council (Council in Trullo) of 692.
But even after that date irregularities occur from time to time,
especially in the East.</p>

<p>In the fixing of the Canon, as in the fixing of doctrine, the
decisive influence proceeded from the bishops and the theologians
of the period 325-450. But behind these was the practice of the
greater churches; and behind that again was not only the lead
of a few distinguished individuals, but the instinctive judgment
of the main body of the faithful. It was really this instinct that
told in the end more than any process of quasi-scientific criticism.
And it was well that it should be so, because the methods of
criticism are apt to be, and certainly would have been when the
Canon was formed, both faulty and inadequate, whereas instinct
brings into play the religious sense as a whole; with spirit
speaking to spirit rests the last word. Even this is not infallible;
and it cannot be claimed that the Canon of the Christian Sacred
Books is infallible. But experience has shown that the mistakes,
so far as there have been mistakes, are unimportant;
and in practice even these are rectified by the natural gravitation
of the mind of man to that which it finds most nourishing
and most elevating.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The separate articles on the various books of
the New Testament may be consulted for detailed bibliographies.
The object of the above sketch has been to embrace in constructive
outline the ground usually covered analytically and on a far larger
scale by Introductions to the New Testament, and by Histories of
the New Testament Canon. In English there is a standard work
of the latter class in Westcott&rsquo;s <i>General Survey of the History of the
Canon of the New Testament</i> (first published in 1855, important revision
and additions in 4th ed. 1874, 7th ed. 1896), with valuable appendix
of documents at the end. There was also a useful collection
of texts by Prof. Charteris of Edinburgh, <i>Canonicity</i> (1880), based
on Kirchhofer, <i>Quellensammlung</i> (1844), but with improvements.
The leading documents are to be had in the handy and reliable <i>Kleine
Texte</i> (ed. Lietzmann, from 1902). On Introduction the
ablest older English work was Salmon, <i>Historical Introduction to the
Study of N.T.</i> (1st ed. 1885, 5th ed. 1891); but,
although still possessing value as argument, this has been more distinctly
left behind by the progress of recent years. England has
made many weighty contributions both to Introduction and Canon,
especially Lightfoot, <i>Essays on Supernatural Religion</i> (collected in
1889); editions of Books of the New Testament and Apostolic
Fathers; Westcott, editions; Hort, especially <i>Romans and
Ephesians</i> (posthumous, 1895); Swete, editions; Knowling and
others. The Oxford Society of Historical Theology put out a useful
<i>New Testament in the Apostolic Fathers</i> in 1905, and Prof. Stanton of
Cambridge, <i>The Gospels as Historical Documents</i> (part i. in 1903).
Prof. Burkitt&rsquo;s <i>Gospel History and its Transmission</i> appeared in
1906. For introductory matter the student will do well to consult
the <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i> (ed. Hastings, 5 vols., 1898-1904) and
<i>Encyclopaedia Biblica</i> (ed. Cheyne and Black, 4 vols., 1899-1903).
Dr Hastings and his contributors belong more to the right wing of
criticism, and Dr Cheyne and his to the left. The systematic Introduction
is a characteristic production of Germany and has done
excellent service in its day, though there are signs that the analytic
method hitherto mainly practised is beginning to give place to
something more synthetic or constructive. The pioneer work in
this latter direction is Weizsäcker&rsquo;s skilful and artistic <i>Apostolisches
Zeitalter</i> (1st ed. 1886, 3rd ed. 1901; Eng. trans. 1894-1895);
somewhat similar on a smaller scale is von Soden, <i>History of Early
Christian Literature</i> (trans., 1906). Special mention should be made
of Wellhausen on the Synoptic Gospels (1903-1905), and Harnack,
<i>Beiträge z. Einleitung in d. N.T.</i> (part i. 1906, part ii. 1907). The
most important recent works on Introduction and Canon have been
those of H.J. Holtzmann (1st ed. 1885, 3rd ed. 1902), B. Weiss
(1st ed. 1886, 3rd ed. 1897); a series of works by Th. Zahn,
almost colossal in scale and exhaustive in detail, embracing <i>Gesch.
d. neut. Kanöns</i> (2 vols., 1888-1892, third to follow), <i>Forschungen
z. Gesch. d. neut. Kan.</i> (7 parts, 1881-1907), <i>Einleitung</i> (2 vols., 1897-1899),
<i>Grundriss d. Gesch. d. neut. Kan.</i> (1st ed. 1901, 2nd ed. 1904);
A. Jülicher, <i>Einleitung</i> (1st and 2nd ed. 1894, 5th and 6th ed.
1906; Eng. trans. by Miss Janet Ward, 1904). Zahn and Jülicher
may be said to supplement and correct each other, as they write
from very different points of view, and on Jülicher&rsquo;s side there is
no lack of criticism of his great opponent. Zahn&rsquo;s series is monumental
in its way, and his <i>Grundriss</i> is very handy and full of closely
packed and (in statements of facts) trustworthy matter. Jülicher&rsquo;s
work is also highly practical, very complete and well proportioned
in scale, and up to a certain point its matter is also excellent. The
<i>History of the Canon</i>, by the Egyptologist Joh. Leipoldt (Leipzig,
1907), may also be warmly recommended; it is clear and methodical,
and does not make the common mistake of assigning too much to
secondary causes; the author does not forget that he is dealing
with a sacred book, and that he has to show why it was held
sacred.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">2. <i>Texts and Versions</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>apparatus criticus</i> of the New Testament consists, from
one point of view, entirely of MSS.; but these MSS. may be divided
into three groups: (A) Greek MSS., which in practice are known
&ldquo;The MSS,&rdquo; (B) MSS. of versions in other languages representing
translations from the Greek, (C) MSS. of other writings
whether in Greek or other languages which contain quotations
from the New Testament.</p>

<p>(A) <i>Greek MSS.</i>&mdash;These may be divided into classes according
to style of writing, material, or contents. The first method
distinguishes between uncial or majuscule, and cursive or
minuscule; the second between papyrus, vellum or parchment,
and paper (for further details see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Manuscript</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Palaeography</a></span>);
and the third distinguishes mainly between Gospels,
Acts and Epistles (with or without the Apocalypse), New
Testaments (the word in this connexion being somewhat
broadly interpreted), lectionaries and commentaries.</p>

<p>Quite accurate statistics on this subject are scarcely attainable.
Von Soden&rsquo;s analysis of numbers, contents and date may be
tabulated as follows, but it must be remembered that it reckons
many small fragments as separate MSS., especially in the earlier
centuries. It is also necessary to add that there is one small
scrap of papyrus of the 3rd century containing a few verses of
the 4th Gospel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page879" id="page879"></a>879</span></p>

<p>This table says nothing about style of writing or material, but
it may be taken as a general rule that MSS. earlier than the 13th
century are on vellum and later than the 14th century are on
paper, and that MSS. earlier than the 9th century are uncial and
later than the 10th are minuscule. There are said to be 129
uncial MSS. of the New Testament (Kenyon, <i>Textual Criticism
of the New Testament</i>, p. 45), but it is not easy to be quite
accurate on the point.</p>

<p>Besides the MSS. mentioned in the table above, there are
281 MSS. containing commentaries on the Gospels, 169 on Acts
and Epistles, 66 on the Apocalypse, 1072 lectionaries of the
Gospels and 287 of Acts and Epistles, making a grand total of
3698 MSS. It must be remembered that the dating of the MSS.,
especially of minuscules, is by no means certain: Greek Palaeography
is a difficult subject, and not all the MSS. have been
investigated by competent palaeographers.</p>

<p>The notation of this mass of MSS. is very complicated. There
are at present two main systems: (1) Since the time of Wetstein
it has been customary to employ capital letters, at first of the
Latin and latterly also of the Greek and Hebrew alphabets, to
designate the uncials, and Arabic figures to designate the minuscules.
Of this system there are two chief representatives,
Gregory and Scrivener. These agree in the main, but differ for
the more recently discovered minuscules. Gregory&rsquo;s notation
is more generally used, and Scrivener&rsquo;s, though still followed by
a few English scholars, is likely to become obsolete. This
method of notation has various disadvantages. There are not
enough letters to cover the uncials, the same letter has to serve
for various fragments which are quite unconnected except by
the accident of simultaneous discovery, and no information is
given about the MS. referred to. (2) To remedy these drawbacks
an entirely new system was introduced in 1902 by von Soden in
his <i>Die Schriften des neuen Testaments</i>, Bd. 1, Abt. 1, pp. 33-40.
He abandons the practice of making a distinction between uncial
and minuscule, on the ground that for textual criticism the style
of writing is less important than the date and contents of a MS.
To indicate these he divided MSS. into three classes, (1) New
Testaments (the Apocalypse being not regarded as a necessary
part), (2) Gospels, and (3) Acts, Epistles and Apocalypse (the
latter again being loosely regarded). These three classes he distinguished
as &delta; (= <span class="grk" title="diathaekae">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#951;</span>), &epsilon; (= <span class="grk" title="enaggelion">&#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>) and &alpha; (= <span class="grk" title="apostolos">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>).
To these letters he attaches numbers arranged on a principle
showing the century to which the MS. belongs and defining its
contents more precisely. The number is determined thus:&mdash;MSS.
of the &delta; and &alpha; classes from the earliest period to the 9th
century inclusive are numbered 1 to 49; those of the 10th
century 50 to 99; for the later centuries numbers of three figures
are used, and the choice is made so that the figure in the hundreds&rsquo;
place indicates the century, 1 meaning 11th century, 2 meaning
12th century, and so on; to all these numbers the appropriate
letter, if it be &delta; or &alpha;, must be always prefixed, but if it be &epsilon;, only
when there is any chance of ambiguity. In &delta; MSS. a distinction
is made for those of the 11th and subsequent centuries by
reserving 1 to 49 in each hundred for MSS. containing the
Apocalypse, 50 to 99 for those which omit it. Similarly, in &alpha;
MSS. a distinction is made according to their contents; the
three-figure numbers are reserved for MSS. which contain Acts,
Catholic Epistles and Pauline Epistles with or without the
Apocalypse, the presence or absence of which is indicated as in
the &delta; MSS.; but when a MS. consists of only one part a &ldquo;1&rdquo;
is prefixed, thus making a four-figure number, and the precise
part is indicated by the two last of the four figures; 00-19 means
Acts and Catholic Epistles, 20-69 means Pauline Epistles and
70-99 means Apocalypse. In the case of &epsilon; MSS. 1-99 is used for
the earliest MSS. up to the 9th century, and as this is insufficient,
the available numbers are increased by prefixing a 0, and
reckoning a second hundred from 01 to 099; 1000 to 1099 are
MSS. of the 10th century; 100 to 199 are MSS. of the 11th
century, 200-299 of the 12th century, and so on; as this is
insufficient, the range of numbers is increased by prefixing a 1,
and so obtaining another hundred, <i>e.g.</i> 1100 to 1199, and in the
12th and subsequent centuries, where even this is not enough,
by passing on to the thousands and using 2000-2999 for the
12th century, 3000-3999 for the 13th and so on. In each case
&epsilon; is prefixed whenever there is any chance of ambiguity. It is
claimed that this system gives the maximum of information
about a MS., and that it leaves room for the addition of any
number of MSS. which are likely to be discovered. At present
it has not seriously threatened the hold of Gregory&rsquo;s notation on
the critical world, but it will probably have to be adopted, at
least to a large extent, when von Soden&rsquo;s text is published.</p>

<p>It is neither possible nor desirable to give any description of
most of these MSS., but the following are, critically, the most
important.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Uncials</span>.&mdash;<i>Codex Vaticanus</i> (Vat. Gr, 1209), Greg. B, v. Soden
&delta;1; an uncial MS. of the 4th century. It is written in three columns
and has forty-two lines to the column. It originally
contained the whole Bible, but in the New Testament
<span class="sidenote">Codex Vaticanus.</span>
Heb. ix. 14, xiii. 25, 1 and 2 Tim., Tit., Philemon, Apoc.,
are now missing. It was written by three scribes of whom the writer
of the New Testament was identified by Tischendorf as the scribe
D of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> (<i>cod. Sinaiticus</i>). The text has been corrected by two scribes,
one (the <span class="grk" title="diorthotaes">&#948;&#953;&#959;&#961;&#952;&#974;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>) contemporary with the original writer, the other
belonging to the 10th or 11th century. The latter probably also
re-inked the whole of the MS. and introduced a few changes in the
text, though some critics think that this was done by a monk of
the 15th century who supplied the text of the lacuna in Heb. and
of the Apocalypse from a MS. belonging to Bessarion. The text is
the best example of the so-called Neutral Text, except in the Pauline
epistles, where it has a strong &ldquo;Western&rdquo; element. How this
MS. came to be in the Vatican is not known. It first appears in the
catalogue of 1481 (Bibl. Vat. MS. Lat. 3952 f. 50), and is not in the
catalogue of 1475, as is often erroneously stated on the authority
of Vercellone. It was, therefore, probably acquired between the
years 1475 and 1481. The problem of its earlier history is so entangled
with the similar questions raised by &chi; that the two cannot
well be discussed separately. [Phototypic editions have been
issued in Rome in 1889-1890 and in 1905.]</p>

<p><i>Codex Sinaiticus</i> (St Petersburg, Imperial library), Greg. <span title="alef">&#1488;</span>,
von Soden &delta;2; an uncial MS. of the 4th century. It was found
in 1844 by C. Tischendorf (<i>q.v.</i>) in the monastery of
St Catherine on Mt. Sinai, and finally acquired by the
<span class="sidenote">Sinaiticus.</span>
tsar in 1869. It is written on thin vellum in four columns
of forty-eight lines each to a page. It contained originally the
whole Bible, and the New Testament is still complete. At the end
it also contains the Ep. of Barnabas and the <i>Shepherd</i> of Ilermas,
unfortunately incomplete, and there was probably originally some
other document between these two. The text was written, according
to Tischendorf, by four scribes, of whom he identified one as also
the scribe of <i>cod. Vaticanus</i>. It was corrected many times, especially
in the 6th century, by a scribe known as <span title="alef">&#1488;</span><span class="sp">a</span> and in the 7th
by <span title="alef">&#1488;</span><span class="sp">c</span>. It has, in the main, a Neutral text, less mixed in the
Epistles than that of B, but not so pure in the Gospels. The corrections
of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span><span class="sp">c</span> are important, as they are based (according to a note
by that scribe, at the end of Esther) on an early copy which had
been corrected by Pamphilus, the disciple of Origen, friend of
Eusebius and founder of a library at Caesarea.</p>

<p>[The text of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> was published in Tischendorf&rsquo;s <i>Bibliorum codex
Sinaiticus Petropolitanus</i> (vol. iv.,1862), and separately in his <i>Novum
Testamentum Sinaiticum</i> (1863); in 1909 it was published in collotype
by the Clarendon Press, Oxford. The relations of &chi;<span class="sp">o</span> to
Pamphilus are studied by Bousset in &ldquo;Textkritische Studien zum
N.T.&rdquo; (in <i>Texte u. Untersuchungen</i>, xi. 4).]</p>

<p>If Tischendorf was right in identifying the scribe of B with that
of part of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span>, it is obvious that these MSS. probably come from the
same place. He was probably wrong, but there are some indications
of relationship to justify the same view. The two most probable
places seem to be Caesarea and Alexandria. The case for Caesarea
is that the colophon written by <span title="alef">&#1488;</span><span class="sp">c</span> at the end of Esther, and also
of Ezra, shows that <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> was then in the library of Caesarea, and that
a chapter division in Acts found both in <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> and B can also be traced
to the same library. This is a fairly strong case, but it falls short
of demonstration because it cannot be shown that the MS. corrected
by Pamphilus was still at Caesarea when it was used by <span title="alef">&#1488;</span>, and
because it is not certain either that the chapter divisions in Acts
were added by the original scribes, or that <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> and B were at that
time in their original home, or that the chapter divisions were
necessarily only to be found at Caesarea. The case for Alexandria
depends partly on the orthography of B, which resembles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page880" id="page880"></a>880</span>
Graeco-Coptic papyri, partly on the order of the Pauline epistles. At
present, both in <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> and B, Hebrews is placed after 2 Thess., but in
<b>B</b> there is also a continuous numeration of sections throughout
the epistles, according to which 1 to 58 cover Romans to Galatians,
but Ephesians, the next epistle, begins with 70 instead of 59, and
the omitted section numbers are found in Hebrews. Obviously,
the archetype placed Hebrews between Galatians and Ephesians,
but the scribe altered the order and put it between 2 Thess. and
1 Tim., though without changing the section numbers. This older
order of the epistles is only found elsewhere in the Sahidic version
of the New Testament, and it was probably therefore the old
Egyptian or Alexandrian order. Moreover, we know from the Festal
letter of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 367 (according to the Greek and Syriac texts, but not
the Sahidic), that Athanasius then introduced the order of the
epistles which is now given in <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> B. This is strong evidence for
the view that the archetype of B came from Alexandria or the
neighbourhood, and was older than the time of Athanasius, but it
scarcely proves that B itself is Alexandrian, for the order of epistles
which it gives is also that adopted by the council of Laodicea in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 363, and may have been introduced elsewhere, perhaps in
Caesarea. A further argument, sometimes based upon and sometimes
in turn used to support the foregoing, is that the text of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> B
represents that of Hesychius; but this is extremely doubtful (see
the section <i>Textual Criticism</i> below).</p>

<p>[The question of the provenance of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> and B may best be studied
in J. Rendel Harris, <i>Stichometry</i> (Cambridge, 1893), pp. 71-89;
J. Armitage Robinson, &ldquo;Euthaliana,&rdquo; <i>Texts and Studies</i>, iii. 3
(Cambridge, 1895), esp. pp. 34-43 (these more especially for the
connexion with Caesarea); A. Rahfls, &ldquo;Alter und Heimat der
vatikanischer Bibelhandschrift,&rdquo; in the <i>Nachrichten der Gesell. der
Wiss. zu Göttingen</i> (1899), vol. i. pp. 72-79; and O. von Gebhardt in
a review of the last named in the <i>Theologische Literaturzeitung</i> (1899),
col. 556.]</p>

<p><i>Codex Bezae</i> (Cambridge Univ. Nu. 2, 41), Greg. D, von Soden &delta; 5;
an uncial Graeco-Latin MS. not later than the 6th century and
probably considerably earlier. The text is written in one
column to a page, the Greek on the left hand page and
<span class="sidenote">Bezae.</span>
the Latin on the right. It was given to the university of Cambridge
in 1581, but its early history is doubtful. Beza stated that it came
from Lyons and had been always preserved in the monastery of
St Irenaeus there. There is no reason to question Beza&rsquo;s <i>bona
fides</i>, or that the MS. was obtained by him after the sack of Lyons
in 1562 by des Adrets, but there is room for doubt as to the accuracy
of his belief that it had been for a long time in the same monastery.
His information on this point would necessarily be derived from
Protestant sources, which would not be of the highest value, and
there are two pieces of evidence which show that just previously
the MS. was in Italy. In the first place it is certainly identical with
the MS. called &eta; which is quoted in the margin of the 1550 edition
of Robert Stephanus&rsquo; Greek Testament; this MS. according to
Stephanus&rsquo; preface was collated for him by friends in Italy. In the
second place it was probably used at the council of Trent in 1546
by Gul. a Prato, bishop of Clermont in Auvergne, and in the last
edition of the <i>Annotationes</i> Beza quotes his MS. as <i>Claromontanus</i>,
and not as <i>Lugdunensis</i>. These points suggest that the MS. had
only been a short time at Lyons when Beza obtained it. The still
earlier history of the MS. is equally doubtful. H. Quentin has
produced some interesting but not convincing evidence to show that
the MS. was used in Lyons in the 12th century, and Rendel Harris
at one time thought that there were traces of Gallicism in the Latin,
but the latter&rsquo;s more recent researches go to show that the
corrections and annotations varying in date between the 7th and 12th
centuries point to a district which was at first predominantly Greek
and afterwards became Latin. This would suit South Italy, but
not Lyons. The text of this MS. is important as the oldest and
best witness in a Greek MS. to the so-called &ldquo;Western&rdquo; text. (See
the section <i>Textual Criticism</i> below.)</p>

<p><i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> (G. M. reg. ID v.-viii.), Greg. A. von Soden 84;
an uncial MS. of the 5th century. It was given by Cyril Lucar,
patriarch of Constantinople, to Charles I. in 1621. It
appears probable that Cyril Lucar had brought it with
<span class="sidenote">Alexandrinus.</span>
him from Alexandria, of which he had formerly been
patriarch. A note by Cyril Lucar states that it was written by
Thecla, a noble lady of Egypt, but this is probably merely his
interpretation of an Arabic note of the 14th century which states
that the MS. was written by Thecla, the martyr, an obviously absurd
legend; another Arabic note by Athanasius (probably Athanasius III.,
patriarch <i>c.</i> 1308) states that it was given to the patriarchate
of Alexandria, and a Latin note of a later period dates the
presentation in 1098. So far back as it can be traced it is, therefore,
an Alexandrian MS., and palaeographical arguments point in the same
direction. Originally, the MS. contained the whole of the Old and
New Testaments, including the Psalms of Solomon in the former
and 1 and 2 Clement in the latter. It has, however, suffered mutilation
in a few places. Its text in the Old Testament is thought by
some scholars to show signs of representing the Hesychian recension,
but this view seems latterly to have lost favour with students of
the Septuagint. If it be true, it falls in with the palaeographic
indications and suggests an Alexandrian provenance. In the New
Testament it has in the gospels a late text of Westcott and Hort&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Syrian&rdquo; type, but in the epistles there is a strongly marked
&ldquo;Alexandrian&rdquo; element. [Cod. A was published in photographic
facsimile in 1879-1880.]</p>

<p><i>Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus</i> (Paris Nat. Gr. 9), Greg. C,
von Soden &delta; 3; an uncial palimpsest (the top writing being
that of Ephraem) of the 5th century. It was formerly the
property of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, and was probably brought
<span class="sidenote">Ephraemi Syri.</span>
from the east to Italy in the 16th century. Hort (<i>Introduction</i>,
p. 268) has shown from a consideration of displacements in the
text of the Apocalypse that it was copied from a very small MS.,
but this, of course, only holds good of the Apocalypse. It is usually
said that this MS., like A, came originally from Egypt, but this is
merely a palaeographical guess, for which there is no real evidence.
Originally, it contained the whole Bible, but only sixty-four leaves
of the Old Testament remain, and 145 (giving about two-thirds of the
whole) of the New Testament. The character of the text is mixed with
a strong &ldquo;Alexandrian&rdquo; element. [Published in facsimile by Tischendorf
(1843). Discussed by Lagarde in his <i>Ges. Abhandlungen</i>, p. 94.]</p>

<p><i>Codex Claromontanus</i> (Paris Nat. Gr. 107), Greg. D<span class="sp">paul</span>, von
Soden &alpha; 1026; an uncial Graeco-Latin MS. of the 6th century. This
MS. also belonged to Beza, who &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; it from the
monastery of Clermont, near Beauvais. After his death
<span class="sidenote">Claromontanus.</span>
it passed through various private hands and was finally
bought for the French royal library before 1656. It contains the
whole of the Pauline epistles with a few <i>lacunae</i>, and has a famous
stichometric list of books prefixed in another hand to Hebrews. It
is probably the best extant witness to the type of Greek text which
was in use in Italy at an early time. It is closely connected with
<i>cod. Sangermanensis</i> (a direct copy) at St Petersburg, Greg. E<span class="sp">paul</span>,
von Soden &alpha; 1027; <i>cod. Augiensis</i> (Cambridge, Trin. Coll. B xvii. i),
Greg. F<span class="sp">paul</span>, von Soden &alpha; 1029; and <i>cod. Boernerianus</i> (Dresden
K Bibl.), Greg. G<span class="sp">paul</span>, von Soden &alpha; 1028. [The text is published
in Tischendorf&rsquo;s <i>Codex Claromontanus</i> (1852). Its relations to EFG
are best discussed in Westcott and Hort&rsquo;s <i>Introduction</i>, §§ 335-337.]</p>

<p>There are no other uncials equal in importance to the above. The next
most valuable are probably <i>cod. Regius</i> of the 8th century at Paris,
Greg. L, von Soden &epsilon; 56, containing the Gospels; <i>cod. Laudianus</i>
of the 7th century at Oxford, Greg. E, von Soden &alpha; 1001,
a Latino-Greek MS. containing the Acts; <i>cod. Coislinianus</i> of the
6th century in Paris, Turin, Kiev, Moscow and Mt. Atohs, Greg.
H<span class="sp">paul</span>, von Soden &alpha; 1022, containing fragments of þhe Pauline
epistles; and <i>cod. Augiensis</i> of the 9th century in Trinity College,
Cambridge, Greg. F<span class="sp">paul</span>, von Soden &alpha; 1029, a Graeco-Latin MS.
closely related to <i>cod. Claromontanus</i>. [Further details as to these
MSS. with bibliographies can be found in Gregory&rsquo;s <i>Prolegomena</i>
to Tischendorf&rsquo;s <i>N.T.</i> ed. maj. viii.]</p>

<p><span class="sc">Minuscules</span>.&mdash;Very few of these are of real importance. The
most valuable are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The Ferrar Group</i>; a group of eight MSS. known in Gregory&rsquo;s notation
as 13, 69, 124, 346, 543, 788, 826, 828, or in von Soden&rsquo;s as &epsilon; 368, &delta;
505, &epsilon; 1211, &epsilon; 226, &epsilon; 257, &epsilon; 1033, &epsilon; 218, &epsilon; 219, all which,
except 69, in spite of the dating implied by von Soden&rsquo;s notation
were probably written in the 12th century in Calabria. They have
a most peculiar text of a mainly &ldquo;Western&rdquo; type, with some special
affinities to the Old Syriac and perhaps to the Diatessaron. They
are known as the Ferrar group in memory of the scholar who first
published their text, and are sometimes quoted as &Phi; (which, however,
properly is the symbol for <i>Codex Beratinus</i> of the Gospels), and
sometimes as <i>fam.¹³</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Cod. 1 and its Allies</i>; a group of four MSS. known in Gregory&rsquo;s notation
as 1, 118, 131, 209, and in von Soden&rsquo;s as &delta; 50, &epsilon; 346, &delta; 467
and &delta; 457. The dating implied by the latter notation is wrong, as
1 certainly belongs to the 12th, not to the 10th century, and 118 is probably
later than 209. It is sometimes quoted as <i>fam.</i>¹. <i>Fam.</i>¹
and <i>fam.</i>¹³ probably have a common archetype in Mark which is also
represented by codd. 28 (&epsilon; 168), 565 (&epsilon; 93, quoted by Tischendorf and
others as 2<span class="sp">pe</span>) and 700 (&epsilon; 133, quoted by Scrivener and others as
604). It seems to have had many points of agreement with the
Old Syriac, but it is impossible to identify the locality to which it
belonged. Other minuscules of importance are cod. 33 (&delta; 48) at
Paris, which often agrees with <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> BL and is the best minuscule
representative of the &ldquo;Neutral&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alexandrian&rdquo; types of text
in the gospels; cod. 137 (&alpha; 364) at Milan, a valuable &ldquo;Western&rdquo;
text of the Acts; &alpha; 78 (not in Gregory) in the Laura on Mt. Athos, a
MS. of the Acts and epistles, with an early (mixed) type of text and
textual comments and notes from Origen.</p>

<p>[The text of the Ferrar group was published after Ferrar&rsquo;s death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page881" id="page881"></a>881</span>
by T.K. Abbott, <i>A Collation of Four Important MSS. of the Gospels</i>
(Dublin, 1877). It is best discussed by Rendel Harris&rsquo;s books,
<i>The Origin of the Leicester Codex</i> (1887), <i>The Origin of the Ferrar
Group</i> (1893), and <i>The Ferrar Group</i> (1900), all published at
Cambridge; the text of <i>fam.¹</i> with a discussion of its textual relations
is given in K. Lake&rsquo;s &ldquo;Codex 1 and its Allies&rdquo; (<i>Texts and Studies</i>,
vii. 3, 1902); 565 was edited by J. Belsheim in <i>Das Evang. des
Marcus nach d. griech. Cod. Theodorae</i>, &amp;c. (Christiania, 1885), many
corrections to which are published in the appendix to H.S. Cronin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Codex Purpureus,&rdquo; <i>Texts and Studies</i>, v. 4; 700 was published
by H.C. Hoskier in his collation of cod. Evan. 604, London, 1890;

N.F. ii. 4.]</p>
</div>

<p>(B) <i>The Versions.</i>&mdash;These are generally divided into (&alpha;)
<i>primary</i> and (&beta;) <i>secondary</i>; the former being those which
represent translation made at an early period directly from
Greek originals, and the latter being those which were made
either from other versions or from late and unimportant Greek texts.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(&alpha;) The <i>primary</i> versions are three&mdash;Latin, Syriac and Egyptian.</p>

<p><i>Latin Versions.</i>&mdash;1. The Old Latin. According to Jerome&rsquo;s
letter to Pope Damasus in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 384, there was in the 4th century
a great variety of text in the Latin version, &ldquo;<i>Tot enim
exemplaria pene quot codices.</i>&rdquo; This verdict is confirmed
<span class="sidenote">Old Latin.</span>
by examination of the MSS. which have pre-Hieronymian texts.
It is customary to quote these by small letters of the Latin
alphabet, but there is a regrettable absence of unanimity in
the details of the notation. We can distinguish two main types,
African and European. The African version is best represented
in the gospels by <i>cod. Bobiensis</i> (k) of the 5th (some say 6th) century
at Turin, and <i>cod. Palatinus</i> (e) of the 5th century at Vienna, both
of which are imperfect, especially k, which, however, is far the
superior in quality; in the Acts and Catholic epistles by <i>cod.
Floriacensis</i> (f, h. or reg.) of the 6th century, a palimpsest which once
belonged to the monks of Fleury, and by the so-called <i>speculum</i> (m)
or collection of quotations formerly attributed to Augustine but
probably connected with Spain. This scanty evidence is dated and
localized as African by the quotations of Cyprian, of Augustine
(not from the gospels), and of Primasius, bishop of Hadrumetum
(d. <i>c.</i> 560), from the Apocalypse. It is still a disputed point whether
Tertullian&rsquo;s quotations may be regarded as evidence for a Latin
version or as independent translations from the Greek, nor is it
certain that this version is African in an exclusive sense; it was
undoubtedly used in Africa and there is no evidence that it was
known elsewhere originally, but on the other hand there is no proof
that it was not. The European version is best represented in the
gospels by <i>cod. Vercellensis</i> (a) of the 5th century and <i>cod.
Veronensis</i> (b) of the same date (the latter being the better), and by
others of less importance. It is possible that a later variety of it is found
in <i>cod. Monacensis</i> (q) of the 7th century, and <i>cod. Brixianus</i> (f)
of the 6th century, and this used to be called the Italic version,
owing (as F.C. Burkitt has shown) to a misunderstanding of a
remark of Augustine about the &ldquo;Itala&rdquo; which really refers to the
Vulgate. In the Acts the European text is found in <i>cod. Gigas</i>
(g or gig) of the 13th century at Stockholm, in a Perpignan MS.
of the 12th century (p), published by S. Berger, and probably in
<i>cod. Laudianus</i> (e) of the 7th century at Oxford. In the Catholic
epistles it is found in <i>cod. Corbeiensis</i> (f or ff) of the 10th
century at St Petersburg. In the Pauline epistles it is doubtful whether
it is extant at all, though some have found it in the <i>cod.  Claromontanus</i>
(d) and its allies. In the Apocalypse it is found in <i>cod. Gigas.</i></p>

<p>The main problem in connexion with the history of the African
and European versions is whether they were originally one or two.
As they stand at present they are undoubtedly two, and can be
distinguished both by the readings which they imply in the underlying
Greek, and by the renderings which they have adopted. But
there is also a greater degree of similarity between them than can
be explained by accidental coincidence, and there is thus an <i>a priori</i>
case for the theory that one of the two is a revision of the other,
or that there was an older version, now lost, which was the original
of both. If one of the two is the original it is probably the African,
for which there is older evidence, and of which the style both in
reading and rendering seems purer. The chief argument against this
is that it seems paradoxical to think of Africa rather than Rome
as the home of the first Latin version; but it must be remembered
that Roman Christianity was originally Greek, and that the beginnings
of a Latin church in Rome seem to be surprisingly late.</p>

<p>[Editions of Old Latin MSS. are to be found in <i>Old Latin Biblical
Texts</i>, i.-iv. (Oxford);
in Migne&rsquo;s <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, tom. xii.;
and their history is treated especially in
F.C. Burkitt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Old Latin and the Itala&rdquo; (<i>Texts and Studies</i>, iv. 3),
as well as in all books dealing with Textual Criticism generally;

For the textual character and importance of these versions see the
section <i>Textual Criticism</i> below.]</p>

<p>2. The Vulgate or Hieronymian version. To remedy the confusion
produced by the variations of the Latin text Pope Damasus
asked Jerome to undertake a revision, and the latter
published a new text of the New Testament in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 384
<span class="sidenote">Vulgate.</span>
and the rest of the Bible probably within two years. This version
gradually became accepted as the standard text, and after a time
was called the &ldquo;Vulgata,&rdquo; the first to use this name as a title being,
it is said, Roger Bacon. In the Old Testament Jerome made a
new translation directly from the Hebrew, as the Old Latin was
based on the LXX., but in the New Testament he revised the existing
version. He did this fully and carefully in the gospels, but somewhat
superficially in the epistles. He seems to have taken as the
basis of his work the European version as it existed in his time,
perhaps best represented by <i>cod. Monacensis</i> (q) of the 7th century,
and by the quotations in <i>Ambrosiaster</i>, to which <i>cod. Brixianus</i> (f)
of the 6th century would be added if it were not probable that it is
merely a Vulgate MS. with intrusive elements. This type of text
he revised with the help of Greek MSS. of a type which does not
seem to correspond exactly to any now extant, but to resemble
B more closely than any others.</p>

<p>Of Jerome&rsquo;s revision we possess at least 8000 MSS., of which the
earliest may be divided (in the gospels at all events) into groups
connected with various countries; the most important are the
Northumbrian, Irish, Anglo-Irish and Spanish, but the first named
might also be called the Italian, as it represents the text of good
MSS. brought from Italy in the 7th century and copied in the great
schools of Wearmouth and Jarrow. One of the most important,
<i>cod. Amiatinus</i>, was copied in this way in the time of Ceolfrid,
Benedict Biscop&rsquo;s successor, as a present for Pope Gregory in 716.
From these MSS. the original Hieronymian text may be reconstructed
with considerable certainty. The later history of the version
is complicated, but fairly well known. The text soon began to
deteriorate by admixture with the Old Latin, as well from the process
of transcription, and several attempts at a revision were made before
the invention of printing. Of these the earliest of note were undertaken
in France in the 9th century by Alcuin in 801, and almost at
the same time by Theodulf, bishop of Orleans (787-821). In the
11th century a similar task was undertaken by Lanfranc, archbishop
of Canterbury (1069-1089); in the 12th century by Stephen
Harding (1109), third abbot of Citeaux, and by Cardinal Nicolaus
Maniacoria (1150), whose corrected Bible is preserved in the public
library at Dijon. But these were not successful, and in the 13th
century, instead of revisions, attempts were made to fix the text by
providing <i>correctoria</i>, or lists of correct readings, which were the
equivalent of critical editions; of these the chief are the Parisian,
the Dominican (prepared under Hugo de S. Caro about 1240), and
the Vatican. In the 15th century the history of the printed Vulgates
begins. The earliest is the Mentz edition of 1452-1456 (the <i>Mazarin</i>
or &ldquo;42-line&rdquo; Bible), but the earliest of a critical nature were those
of Robert Étienne in 1528 and 1538-1540. In 1546 the council
of Trent decided that the Vulgate should be held as <i>authentica</i>, and
in 1590 Pope Sixtus V. published a new and authoritative edition,
which was, probably at the instigation of the Jesuits, recalled by
Pope Clement VIII. in 1592. In the same year, however, the same
pope published another edition under the name of Sixtus. This is,
according to the Bull of 1592, the authoritative edition, and has
since then been accepted as such in the Latin Church. The critical
edition by J. Wordsworth (bishop of Salisbury) and H.J. White
probably restores the text almost to the state in which Jerome
left it.</p>

<p>[The text of the Vulgate may be studied in Wordsworth and
White, <i>Novum Testamentum Latine</i>; Corssen, <i>Epistula ad Galatas</i>.
Its history is best given in S. Berger&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de la Vulgate</i> (Paris,
1893), in which a good bibliography is given on pp. xxxii.-xxxiv.
The section in Kenyon&rsquo;s handbook to the <i>Textual Criticism of the
New Testament</i> is particularly clear and full.]</p>

<p>Syriac Versions.&mdash;1. The Old Syriac. This is only known to us
at present through two MSS. of the gospels, containing the <i>Evangelion
da-Mepharreshe</i>, or separated gospel, probably
so called in distinction to Tatian&rsquo;s <i>Diatessaron</i>. These
<span class="sidenote">Old Syriac.</span>
MSS. are known as the Curetonian and Sinaitic. The
Curetonian is a MS. of the 5th century. The fragments of it which
we possess are MS. Brit. Mus. addit. 14.451, which was brought in
1842 from the monastery of St. Mary in the Nitrian desert, and
was edited by Cureton in 1858; and three leaves in Berlin (MS.
Orient. Quart. 528) which were bought in Egypt by H. Brugsch
and published by A. Roediger in 1872. It was given to the monastery
of St. Mary in the 10th century, but its earlier history is
unknown. It contained originally the four gospels in the order Mt.,
Mk., Jo., Lc. It is generally quoted as Syr<span class="sp">cur</span> or Syr C. The Sinaitic
was discovered in 1892 by Mrs Lewis and Mrs Gibson in the library
of St. Catherine&rsquo;s monastery on Mt. Sinai, where it still remains, and
was published in 1894 by R.L. Bensly, J. Rendel Harris and F.C.
Burkitt, with an introduction by Mrs Lewis. It is a palimpsest
MS., and the upper writing (lives of saints), dated <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 778, is the
work of &ldquo;John, the anchorite of Beth Mari Qanon, a monastery of
Ma&rsquo;arrath Mesren city in the district of Antioch.&rdquo; This town is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page882" id="page882"></a>882</span>
between Antioch and Aleppo; though the monastery is otherwise
unknown, it seems probable that it was the source of many of the
MSS. now at Sinai. The under writing seems to be a little earlier
than that of the Curetonian; it contains the gospels in the order
Mt., Mc., Lc., Jo. with a few <i>lacunae</i>. There is no evidence that this
version was ever used in the Church services: the Diatessaron was
always the normal Syriac text of the gospels until the introduction
of the Peshito. But the quotations and references in Aphraates,
Ephraem and the Acts of Judas Thomas show that it was known,
even if not often used. It seems certain that the Old Syriac version
also contained the Acts and Pauline epistles, as Aphraates and
Ephraem agree in quoting a text which differs from the Peshito,
but no MSS. containing this text are at present known to exist.</p>

<p>[The text of this version is best given, with a literal English
translation, in F.C. Burkitt&rsquo;s <i>Evangelion da Mepharreshe</i> (Cambridge,
1904).]</p>

<p>2. The Peshito (Simple) Version. This is represented by many
MSS. dating from the 5th century. It has been proved almost to
demonstration by F.C. Burkitt that the portion containing
the gospels was made by Rabbula, bishop of Edessa
<span class="sidenote">Peshito.</span>
(411), to take the place of the Diatessaron, and was based on the
Greek text which was at that time in current use at Antioch. The
Old Testament Peshito is a much older and quite separate version.
The exact limits of Rabbula&rsquo;s work are difficult to define. It seems
probable that the Old Syriac version did not contain the Catholic
epistles, and as these are found in the Peshito they were presumably
added by Rabbula. But he never added 2 Peter, Jude, 2 and 3 John,
or the Apocalypse, and the text of these books, which is sometimes
bound up with the Peshito, really is that of the Philoxenian or of
the Harklean version. A comparison of the Peshito with quotations
in Aphraates and Ephraem shows that Rabbula revised the text
of the Acts and Pauline epistles, but in the absence of MSS.
of the Old Syriac for these books, it is difficult to define the extent
or character of his work. The Peshito is quoted as Syr P, Pesh.,
and Syrsch (because Tischendorf followed the edition of Schaaf).</p>

<p>[The best text of the Peshito is by G.H. Gwilliam, <i>Tetraevangelium
Sanctum</i> (Oxford, 1901); its relations to Rabbula&rsquo;s revision
are shown by F.C. Burkitt, &ldquo;S. Ephraim&rsquo;s quotations from the
Gospel&rdquo; (<i>Texts and Studies</i>, vii. 2, Cambridge, 1901), which renders
out of date F.H. Woods&rsquo;s article on the same subject in <i>Studia
Biblica</i>, iii. pp. 105-138.]</p>

<p>3. The Philoxenian Version. This is known, from a note extant
in MSS. of the Harklean version, to have been made in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 508
for Philoxenus, bishop of Hierapolis, by Polycarpus, a
chorepiscopus. No MSS. of it have survived except in
<span class="sidenote">Philoxenian.</span>
2 Peter, Jude, 2 and 3 John and the Apocalypse. The
four former are found in some MSS. of the Peshito, as the
Philoxenian was used to supply these epistles which were not in
the older version, and the Apocalypse was published in 1892 by Dr
Gwynn from a MS. belonging to Lord Crawford.</p>

<p>[This version may be studied in Isaac H. Hall&rsquo;s <i>Williams MS.</i>
(Baltimore, 1886); in the European editions of the Syriac Bible so
far as the minor Catholic epistles are concerned; in <i>Hermathena</i>,
vol. vii. (1890), pp. 281-314 (article by Gwynn); in <i>Zeitschrift für
Assyriologie</i>, xii. and xiii. (series of articles by Merx); in Gwynn&rsquo;s
<i>The Apocalypse of St John in a Syriac Version</i> (Dublin, 1897).]</p>

<p>4. The Harklean Version. This is a revision of the Philoxenian
made in 616 by Thomas of Harkel (Heraclea), bishop of Hierapolis.
It was apparently an attempt to replace the literary freedom
of the Philoxenian by an extreme literalness. It
<span class="sidenote">Harklean.</span>
represents in the main the text of the later Greek MSS., but it has
important textual notes, and has adopted a system of asterisks
and obeli from the Hexaplar LXX. The source of these notes seems
to have been old MSS. from the library of the Enaton near Alexandria.
The marginal readings are therefore valuable evidence for
the Old Alexandrian text. This version is quoted as Syr H (and
when necessary Syr Hc* or Syr H<span class="sp">mg</span>) and by Tischendorf as Syr<span class="sp">p</span>
(= Syra posterior). It should be noted that when Tischendorf
speaks of Syr<span class="sp">utr</span> he means the Peshito and the Harklean.</p>

<p>[There is no satisfactory critical edition of this version, nor have
the Philoxenian and the Harklean been disentangled from each other.
The printed text is that published in 1778-1803 by J. White at
Oxford under the title <i>Versio Philoxenia</i>; for the marginal notes
see esp. Westcott and Hort, <i>Introduction</i>, and for Acts, Pott&rsquo;s
<i>Abendländische Text der Apostelgesch.</i> (Leipzig, 1900).]</p>

<p>5. The Palestinian or Jerusalem Version. This is a lectionary
which was once thought to have come from the neighbourhood of
Jerusalem, but has been shown by Burkitt to come from
<span class="sidenote">Palestinian.</span>
that of Antioch. It was probably made in the 6th century
in connexion with the attempts of Justinian to abolish
Judaism. Usually quoted as SyrPa and by Tischendorf as Syr<span class="sp">hier</span>.</p>

<p>[The text may be found in Lewis and Gibson&rsquo;s <i>The Palestinian
Syriac Lectionary</i> (London, 1899), (Gospels), and in <i>Studia Sinaitica</i>,
part vi. (Acts and Epistles); its origin is discussed best by F.C.
Burkitt in the <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i>, vol. ii. (1901), pp.
174-183.]</p>

<p>6. The Karkaphensian. This is not a version, but a Syriac
&ldquo;Massorah&rdquo; of the New Testament, <i>i.e.</i> a collection of notes on the
texts. Probably emanates from the monastery of the Skull. Little
is known of it and it is unimportant.</p>

<p>[See Gwilliam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Materials for the Criticism of the Peshito N.T.&rdquo;
in <i>Studia Biblica</i>, in. esp. pp. 60-63.]</p>

<p>7. Tatian&rsquo;s <i>Diatessaron.</i> This is something more than a version.
It was originally a harmony of the four goepels made by Tatian, the
pupil of Justin Martyr, towards the end of the 2nd century.
In its original form it is no longer extant, but it
<span class="sidenote">Tatian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diatessaron.&rdquo;</span>
exists in Arabic (published by Ciasca) and Latin (<i>cod.
Fuldensis</i>) translations, in both of which the text has unfortunately
been almost entirely conformed to the ordinary type.
These authorities are, therefore, only available for the reconstruction
of the order of the selections from the gospels, not for textual criticism
properly so called. For the latter purpose, however, we can use an
Armenian translation of a commentary on the Diatessaron by
Ephraem, and the quotations in Aphraates. The Diatessaron
appears to have been the usual form in which the gospels were read
until the beginning of the 5th century, when the Peshito was put
in its place, and a systematic destruction of copies of the Diatessaron
was undertaken.</p>

<p>[The Diatessaron may be studied in Zahn, &ldquo;Evangelien-harmonie,&rdquo;
article in the <i>Protestantische Realencyklopädie</i> (1898);
J.H. Hill, <i>The Earliest Life of Christ</i> (Edinburgh, 1893); J. Rendel
Harris, <i>Fragments of the Commentary of Ephraim the Syrian</i> (London,
1895); F.C. Burkitt, <i>Evangelion da Mepharreshe</i> (Cambridge, 1904,
vol. ii.).]</p>

<p><i>Inter-relation of Syriac Versions.</i>&mdash;The relations which subsist
between the various Syriac versions remain to be discussed. There
is little room for doubt that the Harklean was based on the Philoxenian,
and the Philoxenian was based on the Peshito, the revision
being made in each case by the help of the Greek MSS. of the day,
but the relations which subsist between the Old Syriac, the Diatessaron
and the Peshito are a more difficult question. There are now
but few, if any, scholars who think that the Peshito is an entirely
separate version, and the majority have been convinced by Burkitt
and recognize (1) that the Peshito is based on a knowledge of the
Old Syriac and the Diatessaron; (2) that it was made by Rabbula
with the help of the contemporary Greek text of the Antiochene
Church. But there is not yet the same degree of consensus as to
the relations between the Old Syriac and the Diatessaron. Here
it is necessary to distinguish between the original text of the Old
Syriac and the existing MSS. of it&mdash;Cur. and Sin. There is no
question that many passages in these show signs of Diatessaron
influence, but this is only to be expected if we consider that from
the end of the 2nd to the beginning of the 5th century the Diatessaron
was the popular form of the gospels. A large discount
has therefore to be made from the agreements between Diatessaron
and Syr. S and C. Still, it is improbable that this will explain
everything, and it is generally conceded that the original Diatessaron
and the original Old Syriac were in some way connected.
The connexion is variously explained, and efforts have been made
to show on which side the dependence is to be found. The most
probable theory is that of Burkitt. He thinks that the first Syriac
translation was that of Tatian (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 175), who brought the Diatessaron
from Rome and translated it into Syriac. There, in the
last days of the 2nd century, when Serapion was bishop of Antioch
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 190-203), a new start was made, and a translation of the
&ldquo;separated Gospels&rdquo; (<i>Evangelion da Mepharreshe</i>) was made from
the MSS. which was in use at Antioch. Probably the maker of this
version was partly guided, especially in his choice of renderings,
by his knowledge of the Diatessaron. Nevertheless, the Diatessaron
remained the more popular and was only driven out by Theodoret
and Rabbula in the 5th century, when it was replaced by the
Peshito. If this theory be correct the Syriac versions represent
three distinct Greek texts:&mdash;(1) the 2nd-century Greek text from
Rome, used by Tatian; (2) the 2nd-century Greek text from Antioch,
used for the Old Syriac; (3) the 2nd-century Greek text from
Antioch, used by Rabbula for the Peshito.</p>

<p>[The best discussion of this point is in vol. ii. of Burkitt&rsquo;s <i>Evangelion
da Mepharreshe.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Egyptian Versions.</i>&mdash;Much less is known at present about the
history of the Egyptian versions. They are found in various
dialects of Coptic, the mutual relations of which are not
yet certain, but the only ones which are preserved with
<span class="sidenote">Coptic.</span>
any completeness are the Bohairic, or Lower Egyptian, and Sahidic,
or Upper Egyptian, though it is certain that fragments of intermediate
dialects such as Middle Egyptian, Fayumic, Akhmimic
and Memphitic also exist. The Bohairic has been edited by G.
Horner. It is well represented, as it became the official version of
the Coptic Church; its history is unknown, but from internal evidence
it seems to have been made from good Greek MSS. of the type
of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span>BL, but the date to which this points depends largely on the
general view taken of the history of the text of the New Testament.
It need not, but may be earlier than the 4th century. The Sahidic
is not so well preserved. G. Homer&rsquo;s researches tend to show that
the Greek text on which it was based was different from that represented
by the Bohairic, and probably was akin to the &ldquo;Western&rdquo;
text, perhaps of the type used by Clement of Alexandria. Unfortunately
none of the MSS. seems to be good, and at present it is
impossible to make very definite use of the version. It is possible
that this is the oldest Coptic version, and this view is supported
by the general probabilities of the spread of Christianity in Egypt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page883" id="page883"></a>883</span>
which suggest that the native church and native literature had their
strength at first chiefly in the southern parts of the country. It
must be noted that Westcott and Hort called the Bohairic Memphitic,
and the Sahidic Thebaic, and Tischendorf called the Bohairic
Coptic.</p>

<p>[See G. Horner&rsquo;s <i>The Coptic Version of the New Testament in the
Northern Dialect</i> (Oxford); Scrivener&rsquo;s <i>Introduction</i> (ed. Miller),
vol. ii. pp. 91-144; and especially an article on &ldquo;Egyptian Versions&rdquo;
in Hastings&rsquo; <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, vol. i. by Forbes
Robinson.]</p>

<p>(&beta;) Among the <i>secondary</i> versions the only one of real importance
is the Armenian.</p>

<p>The Armenian Version.&mdash;The early history of this version is
obscure, but it seems probable that there were two translations
made in the 4th century: (1) by Mesrop with the help of
Hrofanos (Rufinus?) based on a Greek text; (2) by
<span class="sidenote">Armenian.</span>
Sahak, based on Syriac. After the council of Ephesus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 430)
Mesrop and Sahak compared and revised their work with the help
of MSS. from Constantinople. The general character of the version
is late, but there are many places in which the Old Syriac basis can
be recognized, and in the Acts and Epistles, where the Old Syriac
is no longer extant, this is sometimes very valuable evidence.</p>

<p>[See Scrivener (ed. Miller) vol. ii. pp. 148-154; Hastings&rsquo; <i>Dictionary
of the Bible</i>, article on &ldquo;The Armenian Versions of the New Testament,&rdquo;
by F.C. Conybeare; J.A. Robinson, &ldquo;Euthaliana&rdquo; (<i>Texts and Studies</i>, iii. 3),
cap. 5; on the supposed connexion of Mark xvi.
8 ff. with Aristion mentioned in this version, see esp. Swete&rsquo;s <i>The
Gospel according to St Mark</i> (London, 1902), p. cxi.]</p>

<p>Other secondary versions which are sometimes quoted are the
Gothic, Ethiopic, Georgian, Arabic, Anglo-Saxon, Frankish and
Persic. None has any real critical importance; details are given
in Gregory&rsquo;s <i>Prolegomena</i> and in Scrivener&rsquo;s <i>Introduction</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>(C) <i>Quotations in Patristic Writings.</i>&mdash;The value of this source
of evidence lies in the power which it gives us to date and localize
texts. Its limitations are found in the inaccuracy of quotation
of the writers, and often in the corrupt condition of their text.
This latter point especially affects quotations which later scribes
frequently forced into accord with the text they preferred.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>All writers earlier than the 5th century are valuable, but particularly
important are the following groups:&mdash;(1) Greek writers in the
West, especially Justin Martyr, Tatian, Marcion, Irenaeus and
Hippolytus; (2) Latin writers in Italy, especially Novatian, the
author of the <i>de Rebaptismate</i> and Ambrosiaster; (3) Latin writers
in Africa, especially Tertullian and Cyprian; (4) Greek writers in
Alexandria, especially Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Athanasius
and Cyril; (5) Greek writers in the East, especially Methodius of
Lycia and Eusebius of Caesarea; (6) Syriac writers, especially
Aphraates and Ephraem; it is doubtful whether the Diatessaron
of Tatian ought to be reckoned in this group or in (1). None of these
groups bears witness to quite the same text, nor can all of them be
identified with the texts found in existing MSS. or versions, but it
may be said with some truth that group 2 used the European Latin
version, group 3 the African Latin, and group 6 the Diatessaron in
the gospels and the Old Syriac elsewhere, while group I has much
in common with <i>cod. Bezae</i>, though the difference is here somewhat
greater. In group 4 the situation is more complex; Clement used
a text which has most in common with <i>cod. Bezae</i>, but is clearly
far from identical; Origen in the main has the text of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> B; Athanasius
a somewhat later variety of the same type, while Cyril has the
so-called Alexandrian text found especially in L. Group 4 has a
peculiar text which cannot be identified with any definite group of
MSS. For further treatment of the importance of this evidence see
the section <i>Textual Criticism</i> below.</p>

<p>[There is as yet but little satisfactory literature on this subject.
Outstanding work is P.M. Barnard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clement of Alexandria&rsquo;s
Biblical Text&rdquo; (<i>Texts and Studies</i>, v. 5), 1899; Harnack&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eine
Schrift Novatians,&rdquo; in <i>Texte und Untersuchungen</i>, xiii. 4; Souter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ambrosiaster&rdquo; in <i>Texts and Studies</i>, vii. 4; the Society of Historical
Theology&rsquo;s <i>New Testament in the Apostolic Fathers</i>; an
article by Kostschau, &ldquo;Bibelcitate bei Origenes,&rdquo; in the <i>Zeitschrift
f. wissenschaftliche Theologie</i> (1900), pp. 321-378; and on the general
subject especially Nestle&rsquo;s <i>Einführung in das griechische Neue
Testament</i> (Göttingen, 1909), pp. 159-167.]</p>

<p class="pt2 center">3. <i>Textual Criticism.</i></p>

<p>The problem which faces the textual critic of the New Testament
is to reconstruct the original text from the materials
supplied by the MSS., versions, and quotations in early writers,
which have been described in the preceding section on the
<i>apparatus criticus</i>. His object, therefore, is to discover and
remove the various corruptions which have crept into the text,
by the usual methods of the textual critic&mdash;the collection of
material, the grouping of MSS. and other authorities, the reconstruction
of archetypes, and the consideration of transcriptional
and intrinsic probability. No book, however, presents
such a complicated problem or such a wealth of material for the
textual critic.</p>

<p>In a certain wide sense the textual criticism of the New Testament
began as soon as men consciously made recensions and
versions, and in this sense Origen, Jerome, Augustine and many
other ecclesiastical writers might be regarded as textual critics.
But in practice it is general, and certainly convenient, to regard
their work rather as material for criticism, and to begin the
history of textual criticism with the earliest printed editions
which sought to establish a standard Greek Text. It is, of course,
impossible here to give an account of all these, but the following
may fairly be regarded as the epoch-making books from the
beginning to the present time.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Complutensian.</i>&mdash;The first printed text of the Greek Testament
is known as the Complutensian, because it was made under
the direction of Cardinal Ximenes of Alcalá (Lat. <i>Complutum</i>).
It was printed in 1514, and is thus the first printed text, but is not
the first published, as it was not issued until 1522. It is not known
what MSS. Ximenes used, but it is plain from the character of the
text that they were not of great value. His text was reprinted in
1569 by Chr. Plantin at Antwerp.</p>

<p><i>Erasmus.</i>&mdash;The first <i>published</i> text was that of Erasmus. It was
undertaken at the request of Joannes Froben (Frobenius), the
printer of Basel, who had heard of Cardinal Ximenes&rsquo; project and
wished to forestall it. In this he was successful, as it was issued in
1516. It was based chiefly on MSS. at Basel, of which the only
really good one (<i>cod. Evan. 1</i>) was seldom followed. Erasmus issued
new editions in 1519, 1522, 1527 and 1535, and the Aldine Greek
Testament, printed at Venice in 1518, is a reproduction of the first
edition.</p>

<p><i>Stephanus.</i>&mdash;Perhaps the most important of all early editions
were those of Robert Étienne, or Stephanus, of Paris and afterwards
of Geneva. His two first editions (1546, 1549) were based on Erasmus,
the Complutensian, and collations of fifteen Greek MSS.
These are 16mo volumes, but the third and most important edition
(1550) was a folio with a revised text. It is this edition which is
usually referred to as <i>the</i> text of Stephanus. A fourth edition (in
16mo) published at Geneva in 1551 is remarkable for giving the division
of the text into verses which has since been generally adopted.</p>

<p><i>Beza.</i>&mdash;Stephanus&rsquo; work was continued by Theodore Beza, who
published ten editions between 1565 and 1611. They did not
greatly differ from the 1550 edition of Stephanus, but historically
are important for the great part they played in spreading a knowledge
of the Greek text, and as supplying the text which the Elzevirs
made the standard on the continent.</p>

<p><i>Elzevir.</i>&mdash;The two brothers, Bonaventura and Abraham Elzevir,
published two editions at Leiden in 1624 and 1633, based chiefly
on Beza&rsquo;s text. In the preface to the second edition the first is
referred to as &ldquo;textum... nunc ab omnibus receptum,&rdquo; and this
is the origin of the name &ldquo;Textus Receptus&rdquo; (or T.R.) often given
to the ordinary Greek Text. The Elzevir text has formed the basis
of all non-critical editions on the continent, but in England the
1550 edition of Stephanus has been more generally followed. The
importance of both the Stephanus and Elzevir editions is that they
formed a definite text for the purposes of comparison, and so prepared
the way for the next stage, in which scholars busied themselves
with the investigation and collation of other MSS.</p>

<p><i>Walton&rsquo;s Polyglot.</i>&mdash;The first to begin this work was Brian Walton,
bishop of Chester, who published in 1657 in the 5th and 6th volumes
of his &ldquo;polyglot&rdquo; Bible the text of Stephanus (1550) with the
readings of fifteen new MSS. besides those employed by Stephanus
himself. The collations were made for him by Archbishop Ussher.</p>

<p><i>John Fell.</i>&mdash;In 1675 John Fell, dean of Christ Church, published
the Elzevir text with an enlarged apparatus, but even more important
was the help and advice which he gave to the next important
editor&mdash;Mill.</p>

<p><i>John Mill</i>, of Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, influenced by the advice,
and supported by the purse of John Fell until the latter&rsquo;s death,
published in 1707 a critical edition of the New Testament which
has still a considerable value for the scholar. It gives the text of
Stephanus (1550) with collations of 78 MSS., besides those of Stephanus,
the readings of the Old Latin, so far as was then known, the
Vulgate and Peshito, together with full and valuable prolegomena.</p>

<p><i>Bentley.</i>&mdash;A little later Richard Bentley conceived the idea that
it would be possible to reconstruct the original text of the New
Testament by a comparison of the earliest Greek and Latin sources;
he began to collect material for this purpose, and issued a scheme
entitled &ldquo;Proposals for Printing&rdquo; in 1720, but though he amassed
many notes nothing was ever printed.</p>

<p><i>W. Mace.</i>&mdash;Fairness forbids us to omit the name of William (or
Daniel?) Mace, a Presbyterian minister who published <i>The New
Testament in Greek and English</i>, in 2 vols. in 1729, and really anticipated
many of the verdicts of later critics. He was, however, not in
a position to obtain recognition, and his work has been generally
overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page884" id="page884"></a>884</span></p>

<p><i>J.J. Wetstein</i>, one of Bentley&rsquo;s assistants, when living in Basel in
1730, published &ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo; to the Text, and in 1751-1752 (at
Amsterdam) the text of Stephanus with enlarged Prolegomena and
apparatus criticus. His textual views were peculiar; he preferred
to follow late MSS. on the ground that all the earlier copies had
been contaminated by the Latin&mdash;almost reversing the teaching
of Bentley. His edition is historically very important as it introduced
the system of notation which, in the amplified form given to
it by Gregory, is still in general use.</p>

<p><i>J.A. Bengel</i>, abbot of Alpirspach (a Lutheran community), published
in 1734, at Tübingen, an edition of the New Testament which
marks the beginning of a new era. For the first time an attempt
was made to group the MSS., which were divided into African and
Asiatic. The former group contained the few old MSS., the latter
the many late MSS., and preference was given to the African. This
innovation has been followed by almost all critics since Bengel&rsquo;s
time, and it was developed by Griesbach.</p>

<p><i>J.J. Griesbach</i>, a pupil at Halle of J.S. Semler (who in 1764
reprinted Wetstein&rsquo;s Prolegomena, and in comments of his own
took over and expounded Bengel&rsquo;s views), collated many MSS.,
and distinguished three main groups:&mdash;the Alexandrian or Origenian
(which roughly corresponded to Bengel&rsquo;s African), found in ABCL,
the Egyptian version and Origen; the Western, found in D and
Latin authorities; and the Constantinopolitan (Bengel&rsquo;s Asiatic),
found in the later MSS. and in Byzantine writers. His view was
that the last group was the least valuable; but, except when internal
evidence forbade (and he thought that it frequently did so),
he followed the text found in any two groups against the third. His
first edition was published in 1774-1775, his second and improved
edition in 1796 (vol. i.) and 1806. For the second edition he had
the advantage not merely of his own collection of material (published
chiefly in his <i>Symbolae Criticae</i>, 1785-1793), but also of many
collations by Birch, Matthaei and Adler, and an edition with new
collations by F.K. Alter.</p>

<p><i>J.L. Hug</i>, Roman Catholic professor of theology at Freiburg,
published (Stuttgart and Tübingen) his <i>Einleitung in die Schriften
des N. T.</i> (1808); he is chiefly remarkable for the curious way in
which he introduced many critical ideas which were not appreciated
at the time but have since been revived. He accepted Griesbach&rsquo;s
views as a whole, but starting from the known recensions of the
LXX. he identified Griesbach&rsquo;s Alexandrian text with the work of
Hesychius, and the Constantinopolitan with that of Lucian, while
he described Griesbach&rsquo;s Western text as the <span class="grk" title="koinae ekdosis">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8052; &#7956;&#954;&#948;&#959;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p><i>J.M.A. Scholz</i>, a pupil of Hug, inspected and partially collated
nearly a thousand MSS. and assigned numbers to them which have
since been generally adopted. His work is for this reason important,
but is unfortunately inaccurate.</p>

<p><i>K. Lachmann</i>, the famous classical scholar, opened a new era in
textual criticism in 1842-1850, in his <i>N.T. Graece et Latine</i>. In this
great book a break was made for the first time with the traditional
text and the evidence of the late MSS., and an attempt was made
to reconstruct the text according to the oldest authorities. This
was a great step forward, but unfortunately it was accompanied
by a retrogression to the pre-Griesbachian (or rather pre-Bengelian)
days; for Lachmann rejected the idea of grouping MSS., and
having selected a small number of the oldest authorities undertook
always to follow the reading of the majority.</p>

<p><i>C. Tischendorf</i>, the most famous follower of Lachmann, besides
editions of many MSS. and the collation of many more, published
between 1841 and 1869-1872 eight editions of the New Testament
with full critical notes. The eighth edition, which for the first time
contained the readings of <span title="alef">&#1488;</span>, has not yet been equalled, and together
with the Prolegomena, supplied by C.R. Gregory after Tischendorf&rsquo;s
death, is the standard critical edition which is used by scholars
all over the world. At the same time it must be admitted that
it gradually became antiquated. Fresh collations of MSS., and
especially fresh discoveries and investigations into the text of the
versions and Fathers, have given much new information which
entirely changed the character of the evidence for many readings,
and rendered a new edition necessary (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Soden, H. Von</a></span>). As a
collector and publisher of evidence Tischendorf was marvellous, but
as an editor of the text he added little to the principles of Lachmann,
and like Lachmann does not seem to have appreciated the
value of the Griesbachian system of grouping MSS.</p>

<p><i>S.P. Tregelles</i>, an English scholar, like Tischendorf, spent almost
his whole life in the collection of material, and published a critical
edition, based on the earliest authorities, at intervals between
1857 and 1872. His work was eclipsed by Tischendorf&rsquo;s, and his
critical principles were almost the same as the German scholar&rsquo;s,
so that his work has obtained less recognition than would otherwise
have been the case. Tischendorf and Tregelles finished the work
which Lachmann began. They finally exploded the pretensions of
the <i>Textus Receptus</i> to be the original text; but neither of them
gave any explanation of the relations of the later text to the earlier,
nor developed Griesbach&rsquo;s system of dealing with groups of MSS.
rather than with single copies.</p>

<p><i>B.F. Westcott and F.J.A. Hort</i> (commonly quoted as WH), the
Cambridge scholars, supplied the deficiencies of Lachmann, and
without giving up the advantages of his system, and its development
by Tischendorf, brought back the study of the text of the
New Testament to the methods of Griesbach. Their great work was
published in 1881 under the title of <i>The New Testament in the Original
Greek</i>. Their view of the history of the text is that a comparison
of the evidence shows that, while we can distinguish more than one
type of text, the most clearly discernible of all the varieties is first
recognizable in the quotations of Chrysostom, and is preserved in
almost all the later MSS. Though found in so great a number of
witnesses, this type of text is shown not to be the earliest or best
by the evidence of all the oldest MS. versions and Fathers, as well
as by internal evidence. Moreover, a comparison with the earlier
sources of evidence shows that it was built up out of previously
existing texts. This is proved by the &ldquo;conflations&rdquo; which are
found in it. For instance in Mark ix. 38 the later MSS. read
<span class="grk" title="os ouk akolouthei haemin, kai ekolusamen auton oti ouk akolouthei haemin">&#8003;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#8150; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;,
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#8004;&#964;&#953; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#8150; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span>, a
clumsy sentence which is clearly made up out of two earlier
readings, <span class="grk" title="kai ekoluomen auton oti ouk aekolouthei haemin">
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#973;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#8003;&#964;&#953; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7968;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#952;&#949;&#953; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span>, found in <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> BCL
boh., and <span class="grk" title="os ouk akolouthei meth&rsquo; haemon, kai ekoluomen auton">
&#8003;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#8150; &#956;&#949;&#952;&#8125; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#973;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</span>, found
in DX <i>fam.</i>¹, <i>fam.</i>¹³ 28 latt. It is impossible, in face of the
fact that the evidence of the oldest witnesses of all sorts is constantly
opposed to the longer readings, to doubt that WH were
right in arguing that these phenomena prove that the later text was
made up by a process of revision and conflation of the earlier forms.
Influenced by the use of the later text by Chrysostom, WH called
it the Syrian or Antiochene text, and refer to the revision which
produced it as the Syrian revision. They suggested that it might
perhaps be attributed to Lucian, who is known to have made a
revision of the text of the LXX. The earlier texts which were used
for the Syrian revision may, according to WH, be divided into
three:&mdash;(1) the Western text, used especially by Latin writers,
and found also in <i>cod. Bezae</i> and in Syr C; (2) the Alexandrine
text used by Cyril of Alexandria and found especially in CL &Xi; 33;
and (3) a text which differs from both the above mentioned and
is therefore called by WH the Neutral text, found especially in <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> B
and the quotations of Origen. Of these three types WH thought
that the Neutral was decidedly the best. The Alexandrian was
clearly a literary recension of it, and WH strove to show that the
Western was merely due to the non-literary efforts of scribes in other
parts to improve the narrative. The only exception which they
allowed to this general rule was in the case of certain passages,
especially in the last chapters of Luke, where the &ldquo;Western&rdquo;
authorities omit words which are found in the Neutral and Alexandrian
texts. Their reason was that omission seems to be contrary
to the genius of the Western text, and that it is therefore probable
that these passages represent interpolations made in the text on
the Neutral side after the division between it and the Western.
They might be called Neutral interpolations, but WH preferred the
rather clumsy expression &ldquo;Western non-interpolations.&rdquo; Having
thus decided that the Neutral text was almost always right, it only
remained for WH to choose between the various authorities which
preserved this type. They decided that the two best authorities
were <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> and B, and that when these differed the reading of B, except
when obviously an accidental blunder, was probably right. The
great importance of this work of WH lies in the facts that it not
merely condemns but explains the late Antiochene text, and that
it attempts to consider in an objective manner all the existing
evidence and to explain it historically and genealogically. Opinions
differ as to the correctness of the results reached by WH, but there
is scarcely room for doubt that as an example of method their work
is quite unrivalled at present and is the necessary starting-point for
all modern investigations.</p>

<p>Since Westcott and Hort no work of the same importance appeared
up till 1909. Various useful texts have been issued, among which
those of Nestle (<i>Novum Testamentum Graece</i>, Stuttgart, 1904), based
on a comparison of the texts of Tischendorf, WH and Weiss, and
of Baljon (<i>Novum Testamentum Graece</i>, Groningen, 1898), are the
best. The only serious attempt as yet published to print a complete
text independently of other editors is that of B. Weiss (<i>Das Neue
Testament</i>, Leipzig, 1894-1900), but the method followed in this
is so subjective and pays so little attention to the evidence of the
versions that it is not likely to be permanently important. The
text reached is not widely different from that of WH. The new
work in course of preparation by von Soden at Berlin, which promises
to take the place of Tischendorf&rsquo;s edition, must certainly do
this so far as Greek MSS. are concerned, for the whole field has been
reinvestigated by a band of assistants who have grouped and collated
specimens of all known MSS.</p>

<p>Besides these works the chief efforts of textual critics since WH
have been directed towards the elucidation of minor problems, and
the promulgation of certain hypotheses to explain the characteristics
either of individual MSS. or of groups of MSS. Among these
the works of Sanday, Corssen, Wordsworth, White, Burkitt and
Harris on the history of the Old Latin and Vulgate, and especially
the work of Burkitt on the Old Syriac, have given most light on the
subject. These lines of research have been described in the preceding
section on the <i>apparatus criticus</i>. Other noteworthy and interesting,
though in the end probably less important, work has been
done by Blass, Bousset, Schmidtke, Rendel Harris and Chase.
The outline of the chief works is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>F. Blass.</i>&mdash;In his various books on the Acts and third gospel Blass
has propounded a new theory as to the &ldquo;Western&rdquo; text. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page885" id="page885"></a>885</span>
struck by the fact that neither the Western can be shown to be
derived from the Neutral, nor the Neutral from the Western. He
therefore conceived the idea that perhaps both texts were Lucan,
and represented two recensions by the original writer, and he reconstructed
the history as follows. Luke wrote the first edition
of the Gospel for Theophilus from Caesarea; this is the Neutral
text of the Gospel. Afterwards he went to Rome and there revised
the text of the Gospel and reissued it for the Church in that city;
this is the Western (or, as Blass calls it, Roman) text of the Gospel.
At the same time he continued his narrative for the benefit of the
Roman Church, and published the Western text of the Acts. Finally
he revised the Acts and sent a copy to Theophilus; this is the
Neutral text of the Acts. This ingenious theory met with considerable
approval when it was first advanced, but it has gradually been
seen that &ldquo;Western&rdquo; text does not possess the unity which Blass&rsquo;s
theory requires it to have. Still, Blass&rsquo;s textual notes are very
important, and there is a mass of material in his books.</p>

<p><i>Bousset and Schmidtke.</i>&mdash;These two scholars have done much
work in trying to identify smaller groups of MSS. with local texts.
Bousset has argued that the readings in the Pauline epistles found
in <span title="alef">&#1488;</span><span class="sp">c</span> H and a few minuscules represent the text used by Pamphilus,
and on the whole this view seems to be highly probable. Another
group which Bousset has tried to identify is that headed by B,
which he connects with the recension of Hesychius, but this theory,
though widely accepted in Germany, does not seem to rest on a very
solid basis. To some extent influenced by and using Bousset&rsquo;s
results, Schmidtke has tried to show that certain small lines in the
margin of B point to a connexion between that MS. and a Gospel
harmony, which, by assuming that the text of B is Hesychian, he
identifies with that of Ammonius. If true, this is exceedingly important.
Nestle, however, and other scholars think that the lines
in B are merely indications of a division of the text into sense-paragraphs
and have nothing to do with any harmony.</p>

<p><i>Rendel Harris</i> and <i>Chase.</i>&mdash;Two investigations, which attracted
much notice when they were published, tried to explain the phenomena
of the Western text as due to retranslation from early versions
into Greek. Rendel Harris argued for the influence of Latin, and
Chase for that of Syriac. While both threw valuable light on obscure
points, it seems probable that they exaggerated the extent to which
retranslation can be traced; that they ranked <i>Codex Bezae</i> somewhat
too highly as the best witness to the &ldquo;Western&rdquo; text; and that
some of their work was rendered defective by their failure to recognize
quite clearly that the &ldquo;Western&rdquo; text is not a unity. At the
same time, however little of Rendel Harris&rsquo;s results may ultimately
be accepted by the textual critics of the future, his work will always
remain historically of the first importance as having done more
than anything else to stimulate thought and open new lines of
research in textual criticism in the last decade of the 19th century.</p>

<p>The time has not yet come when any final attempt can be made
to bring all these separate studies together and estimate exactly
how far they necessitate serious modification of the views of Westcott
and Hort; but a tentative and provisional judgment would
probably have to be on somewhat the following lines. The work
of WH may be summed up into two theorems:&mdash;(1) The text preserved
in the later MSS. is not primitive, but built up out of earlier
texts;. (2) these earlier texts may be classified as Western, Alexandrian
and Neutral, of which the Neutral is the primitive form.
The former of these theorems has been generally accepted and may
be taken as proved, but the second has been closely criticized and
probably must be modified. It has been approached from two sides,
according as critics have considered the Western or the Neutral and
Alexandrian texts.</p>

<p><i>The Western Text.</i>&mdash;This was regarded by WH as a definite text,
found in D, the Old Latin and the Old Syriac; and it is an essential
part of their theory that in the main these three witnesses represent
one text. On the evidence which they had WH were undoubtedly
justified, but discoveries and investigation have gone far to make it
impossible to hold this view any longer. We now know more about
the Old Latin, and, thanks to Mrs Lewis&rsquo; discovery, much more about
the Old Syriac. The result is that the authorities on which WH
relied for their Western text are seen to bear witness to two texts,
not to one. The Old Latin, if we take the African form as the
oldest, as compared with the Neutral text has a series of interpolations
and a series of omissions. The Old Syriac, if we take
the Sinaitic MS. as the purest form, compared in the same way,
has a similar double series of interpolations and omissions, but
neither the omissions nor the interpolations are the same in the
Old Latin as in the Old Syriac. Such a line of research suggests
that instead of being able, as WH thought, to set the Western
against the Neutral text (the Alexandrian being merely a development
of the latter), we must consider the problem as the comparison
of at least three texts, a Western (geographically), an Eastern and
the Neutral. This makes the matter much more difficult; and an
answer is demanded to the problem afforded by the agreement of
two of these texts against the third. The obvious solution would
be to say that where two agree their reading is probably correct,
but the followers of WH maintain that the agreement of the Western
and Eastern is often an agreement in error. It is difficult to see
how texts, geographically so wide apart as the Old Latin and Old
Syriac would seem to be, are likely to agree in error, but it is certainly
true that some readings found in both texts seem to have little probability.
Sanday, followed by Chase and a few other English
scholars, has suggested that the Old Latin may have been made
originally in Antioch, but this paradoxical view has met with little
support. A more probable suggestion is Burkitt&rsquo;s, who thinks that
many readings in our present Old Syriac MSS. are due to the Diatessaron,
which was a geographically Western text. It may be
that this suggestion will solve the difficulty, but at present it is
impossible to say.</p>

<p><i>The Neutral and Alexandrian Texts.</i>&mdash;WH made it plain that the
Alexandrian text was a literary development of the Neutral, but
they always maintained that the latter text was not confined to,
though chiefly used in Alexandria. More recent investigations
have confirmed their view as to the relation of the Alexandrian
to the Neutral text, but have thrown doubt on the age and wide-spread
use of the latter. Whatever view be taken of the provenance
of <i>Codex Vaticanus</i> it is plain that its archetype had the Pauline
epistles in a peculiar order which is only found in Egypt, and so
far no one has been able to discover any non-Alexandrian writer
who used the Neutral text. Moreover, Barnard&rsquo;s researches into
the Biblical text of Clement of Alexandria show that there is reason
to doubt whether even in Alexandria the Neutral text was used
in the earliest times. We have no evidence earlier than Clement,
and the text of the New Testament which he quotes has more in
common with the Old Latin or &ldquo;geographically Western&rdquo; text
than with the Neutral, though it definitely agrees with no known
type preserved in MSS. or versions. This discovery has put the
Neutral text in a different light. It would seem as though we could
roughly divide the history of the text in Alexandria into three
periods. The earliest is that which is represented by the quotations
in Clement, and must have been in use in Alexandria at the end of
the 2nd and beginning of the 3rd century. It is unfortunately
not found in any extant MS. The second stage is that found in the
quotations of Origen which is fairly well represented in <span title="alef">&#1488;</span> B, though
Origen seems at times to have used MSS. of the earlier type. The
third stage is WH&rsquo;s Alexandrian, found in the quotations of Cyril
of Alexandria and a few MSS. (esp. CL &Xi; &Delta; &Psi;). It is clearly a revision
of the second stage, as WH saw, but we can now add that it
was not merely a literary revision but was influenced by the tendency
to revive readings which are found in the first stage but rejected in
the second.</p>

<p>It thus seems probable that WH&rsquo;s theory must be modified, both
as regards the &ldquo;Western&rdquo; text, which is seen not to be a single text
at all, and as regards the &ldquo;Neutral&rdquo; text, which seems to be
nothing more than the second stage of the development of the
text in Alexandria. But the importance of these modifications is
something more than the doubt which they have thrown on WH&rsquo;s
theories: they have really shifted the centre of gravity of the textual
problem.</p>

<p>Formerly the Greek uncials, which go back to the 4th century,
were regarded as the most important source of evidence, and were
supposed to have the decisive vote; but now it is becoming plain
that still more important, though unfortunately much less complete,
is the evidence of the versions and of quotations by early writers.
Both of these point to the existence in the 3rd and even 2nd century
of types of text which differ in very many points from anything
preserved in Greek MSS. Yet there is no doubt that both of them
ultimately represent Greek MSS. which are no longer extant. The
question, therefore, is whether we ought not to base our text on the
versions and ecclesiastical quotations rather than on the extant
Greek MSS. Two positions are possible: (1) We may defend a
text based on the best existing Greek MSS. by the argument that
these represent the text which was approved by competent judges
in the 4th century, and would be found to exist in earlier MSS. if
we possessed them. The weak point of this argument is the lack
of evidence in support of the second part. The only possible sources
of evidence, apart from the discovery of fresh MSS., are the versions,
and they do not point to existence in the 2nd or 3rd century of
texts agreeing with the great uncials. It is also possible to argue,
as WH did, on the same side, that the purest form of text was preserved
in Alexandria, from which the oldest uncials are directly or
indirectly derived, but this argument has been weakened if not
finally disposed of by the evidence of Clement of Alexandria. It
is, of course, conceivable that Clement merely used bad MSS., and
that there were other MSS. which he might have used, agreeing
with the great uncials, but there is no evidence for this view. (2)
If we reject this position we must accept the evidence as giving
the great uncials much the same secondary importance as Westcott
and Hort gave to the later MSS., and make an attempt to reconstruct
a text on the basis of versions and Fathers. The adoption of this
view sets textual critics a peculiarly difficult task. The first stage
in their work must be the establishment of the earliest form of each
version, and the collection and examination of the quotations in
all the early writers. This has not yet been done, but enough has
been accomplished to point to the probability that the result will
be the establishment of at least three main types of texts, represented
by the Old Syriac, the Old Latin and Clement&rsquo;s quotations,
while it is doubtful how far Tatian&rsquo;s Diatessaron, the quotations in
Justin and a few other sources may be used to reconstruct the type
of Greek text used in Rome in the 2nd century when Rome was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page886" id="page886"></a>886</span>
primarily a Greek church. The second stage must be the comparison
of these results and the attempt to reconstruct from them
a Greek text from which they all arose.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">4. Higher Criticism.</p>

<p>The New Testament is a series of early Christian writings
which the Church came to regard as canonical, <i>i.e.</i> they were
placed in the same category as the Old Testament, the writings
which the Christian had inherited from the Jewish Church.
Just as the ancient Scriptures were considered to be the Word
of God, so that what they contained was necessarily the true
and inspired doctrine, so also the New Testament was available
for proving the Church&rsquo;s dogma. The assured canonicity of the
whole New Testament resulted in its use by the medieval theologians,
the Schoolmen, as a storehouse of proof-texts. Thus
the New Testament seemed to exist in order to prove the Church&rsquo;s
conclusions, not to tell its own tale.</p>

<p>The <i>Novum Instrumentum</i> published by Erasmus in 1516
(see above, <i>Textual Criticism</i>) contained more than the mere
Editio Princeps of the Greek text: Erasmus accompanied
it with a Latin rendering of his own, in which
<span class="sidenote">Erasmus.</span>
he aimed at giving the meaning of the Greek without blindly
following the conventional phraseology of the Latin Vulgate,
which was the only form in which the New Testament had been
current in western Europe for centuries. This rendering of
Erasmus, together with his annotations and prefaces to the
several books, make his editions the first great monument of
modern Biblical study. Medieval Bibles contain short prefaces
by St Jerome and others. The stereotyped information supplied
in these prefaces was drawn from various sources: Erasmus
distinguishes, <i>e.g.</i>, between the direct statements in the Acts and
the inferences which may be drawn from incidental allusions in
the Pauline Epistles, or from the statements of ancient non-canonical
writers.<a name="fa54a" id="fa54a" href="#ft54a"><span class="sp">54</span></a> This discrimination of sources is the starting-point
of scientific criticism.</p>

<p>The early champions of Church reform in the beginning of
the 16th century found in the Bible their most trustworthy
weapon. The picture of Apostolical Christianity
found in the New Testament offered indeed a glaring
<span class="sidenote">The Reformers.</span>
contrast to the papal system of the later middle ages.
Moreover, some of the &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; used by the Schoolmen
had been discovered by the New Learning of the Renaissance
to be no authorities at all, such as the writings falsely attributed
to Dionysius the Areopagite. When, therefore, the breach came,
and the struggle between reformers and conservatives within
the undivided Church was transformed into a struggle between
Protestants and Romanists, it was inevitable that the authority
which in the previous centuries had been ascribed to the Church
should be transferred by the Reformed Churches to the Bible.
&ldquo;The Bible, the Bible alone, is the religion of Protestants&rdquo;<a name="fa55a" id="fa55a" href="#ft55a"><span class="sp">55</span></a> did
really express the watchword of the anti-Romanist parties,
especially towards the close of the acuter struggle. At the
beginning of the movement the New Testament itself had been
freely criticized. Luther, like his countrymen of to-day, judged
the contents of the New Testament by the light of his leading
convictions; and in his German translation, which occupies
the same place in Germany as the Authorized Version of 1611
does in English-speaking lands, he even placed four of the
books (Hebrews, James, Jude, Apocalypse) in an appendix at the
end, with prefaces explanatory of this drastic act of criticism.
But though we may trace a real affiliation between the principles
of Luther and modern German critical study&mdash;notably in the
doctrines of the Gospel within the Gospel and of the residual
Essence of Christianity&mdash;Luther&rsquo;s discriminations were in the
17th century ignored in practice.</p>

<p>From cover to cover the whole New Testament was regarded
at the beginning of the 18th century by almost all Protestants
as the infallible revelation of the true religion. The
doctrines of Christianity, and in many communities
<span class="sidenote">Influence of textual criticism.</span>
the customs of the Church, were held to be inferences
from the inspired text of the Scriptures. The first
serious blow to this view came from the study of textual criticism.
The editions of Mill (1707) and of Wetstein (1751) proved once
for all that variations in the text, many of them serious, had
existed from the earliest times. It was evident, therefore, that
the true authority of the New Testament could not be that of a
legal code which is definite in all its parts. More important still
was the growing perception of the general uniformity of nature,
which had forced itself with increasing insistence upon men&rsquo;s
minds as the study of the natural sciences progressed in the
17th and 18th centuries. The miracles of the New Testament,
which had formerly been received as bulwarks of Christianity,
now appeared as difficulties needing explanation. Furthermore,
the prevailing philosophies of the 18th century tended to demand
that a real divine revelation should be one which expressed
itself in a form convincing to the reason of the average plain
man, whatever his predispositions might be; it was obvious
that the New Testament did not wholly conform to this
standard.</p>

<p>But if the New Testament be not itself the direct divine
revelation in the sense of the 18th century, the question still
remains, how we are to picture the true history of the
rise of Christianity, and what its true meaning is.
<span class="sidenote">Rationalists.</span>
This is the question which has occupied the theologians
of the 19th and 20th centuries. Perhaps the most significant
event from which to date the modern period is the publication
by Lessing in 1774-1777 of the &ldquo;Wolfenbüttel Fragments,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
H.S. Reimarus&rsquo; posthumous attack on Christianity, a work
which showed that the mere study of the New Testament is not
enough to compel belief in an unwilling reader. Lessing&rsquo;s
publication also helped to demonstrate the weakness of the
older rationalist position, a position which really belongs to the
18th century, though its best-remembered exponent, Dr H.E.G.
Paulus, only died in 1851. The characteristic of the rationalists
was the attempt to explain away the New Testament miracles
as coincidences or naturally occurring events, while at the same
time they held as tenaciously as possible to the accuracy of the
letter of the New Testament narratives. The opposite swing
<span class="sidenote">Strauss.</span>
of the pendulum appears in D.F. Strauss: in his
<i>Leben Jesu</i> (1833) he abandons the shifts and expedients
by which the rationalists eliminated the miraculous
from the Gospel stories, but he abandons also their historical
character. According to Strauss the fulfilments of prophecy
in the New Testament arise from the Christians&rsquo; belief that the
Christian Messiah must have fulfilled the predictions of the
prophets, and the miracles of Jesus in the New Testament either
originate in the same way or are purely mythical embodiments
of Christian doctrines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page887" id="page887"></a>887</span></p>

<p>The main objection to this presentation, as also to that of
the rationalists, is that it is very largely based not upon the
historical data, but upon a pre-determined theory.
Granted the philosophical basis, the criticism practised
<span class="sidenote">Tübingen school.</span>
upon the New Testament by Paulus and Strauss
follows almost automatically. Herein lies the permanent importance
of the work of Ferdinand Christian Baur, professor
of theology at Tübingen from 1826 to 1860. The corner-stone
of his reconstruction of early Christian history is derived not
so much from philosophical principles as from a fresh study
of the documents. Starting from Galatians and I Corinthians,
which are obviously the genuine letters of a Christian leader
called Paul to his converts, Baur accepted 2 Corinthians and
Romans as the work of the same hand. From the study of these
contemporary and genuine documents, he elaborated the theory
that the earliest Christianity, the Christianity of Jesus and the
original apostles, was wholly Judaistic in tone and practice.
Paul, converted to belief in Jesus as Messiah after the Crucifixion,
was the first to perceive that for Christians Judaism had ceased
to be binding. Between him and the older apostles arose a long
and fierce controversy, which was healed only when at last his
disciples and the Judaizing disciples of the apostles coalesced
into the Catholic Church. This only occurred, according to
Baur, early in the 2nd century, when the strife was finally
allayed and forgotten. The various documents which make
up the New Testament were to be dated mainly by their relation
to the great dispute. The Apocalypse was a genuine work of
John the son of Zebedee, one of the leaders of the Judaistic
party, but most of the books were late, at least in their present
form. The Acts, Baur thought, were written about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 140,
after the memory of the great controversy had almost passed
away. All four Gospels also were to be placed in the 2nd century,
though that according to Matthew retained many features
unaltered from the Judaistic original upon which it was based.</p>

<p>The Tübingen school founded by Baur dominated the theological
criticism of the New Testament during a great part of
the 19th century and it still finds some support. The
main position was not so much erroneous as one-sided.
<span class="sidenote">Later views.</span>
The quarrel between St Paul and his opponents did
not last so long as Baur supposed, and the great catastrophe
of the fall of Jerusalem effectually reduced thorough-going
Judaistic Christianity into insignificance from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70 onwards.
Moreover, St Paul&rsquo;s converts do not seem to have adopted
consistent &ldquo;Paulinism&rdquo; as a religious philosophy. St Paul
was an emancipated Jew, but his converts were mostly Greeks,
and the permanent significance of St Paul&rsquo;s theories of law and
faith only began to be perceived after his letters had been
collected together and had been received into the Church&rsquo;s
canon. All these considerations tend to make the late dates
proposed by Baur for the greater part of the New Testament
books unnecessary; the latest investigators, notably Professor A.
Harnack of Berlin, accept dates that are not far removed from
the ancient Christian literary tradition.</p>

<p>Literary criticism of the Gospels points to a similar conclusion.
A hundred years&rsquo; study of the synoptic problem, <i>i.e</i>. the causes
which make the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark and Luke
at once so much alike and so different, has resulted in the demonstration
of the priority of Mark, which &ldquo;was known to Matthew
and Luke in the same state and with the same contents as we
have it now.&rdquo;<a name="fa56a" id="fa56a" href="#ft56a"><span class="sp">56</span></a> This Gospel may be dated a very few years
after <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70. Luke and Matthew appear to have been published
between 80 and 100.<a name="fa57a" id="fa57a" href="#ft57a"><span class="sp">57</span></a> Besides the Gospel of Mark these Evangelists
made use of another document, now lost, which contained
many sayings of Jesus and some narratives not found in Mark.
This document is by many scholars identified with the &ldquo;Logia,&rdquo;
mentioned by Papias (Eusebius, <i>Ch. Hist</i>. in. 39) as being the
work of Matthew the Apostle, but the identification is not certain.</p>

<p>The Johannine writings, <i>i.e.</i> the Fourth Gospel and the three
Epistles of John, represent the view of Christ and Christianity
taken by a Christian teacher, who seems to have lived and
written in Asia Minor at the close of the 1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> The
value of the Fourth Gospel as a narrative of events is a matter
of dispute, but the view of the personality of Jesus Christ set
forth in it is unquestionably that which the Church has accepted.</p>

<p>The discoveries of papyri in Upper Egypt during recent years,
containing original letters written by persons of various classes
and in some cases contemporary with the Epistles of the New
Testament, have immensely increased our knowledge of the
Greek of the period, and have cleared up not a few difficulties
of language and expression. More important still is the application
of Semitic study to elucidate the Gospels. It is idle indeed
to rewrite the Gospel narratives in the Aramaic dialect spoken by
Christ and the apostles, but the main watchwords of the Gospel
theology&mdash;phrases like &ldquo;the Kingdom of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the World to
come,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Father in Heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Son of Man,&rdquo;&mdash;can be
more or less surely reconstructed from Jewish writings, and their
meaning gauged apart from the special significance which they
received in Christian hands. This line of investigation has been
specially followed by Professor G. Dalman in his <i>Worte Jesu</i>.
The study of the Semitic elements in early Christianity is less
advanced than the study of the Greek elements, so that it is
doubtless from the Semitic side that further progress in the
criticism of the New Testament may be expected.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">5. <i>New Testament Chronology</i>.</p>

<p>The subject of the chronology of the New Testament falls
naturally into two distinct sections&mdash;the chronology of the
Gospels, that is, of the life of Christ; and the chronology of
the Acts, that is, of the apostolic age.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>The Chronology of the Gospels.</i></p>

<p>The data group themselves round three definite points and
the intervals between them: the definite points are the Nativity,
the Baptism and the Crucifixion; the age of Christ at the time
of the Baptism connects the first two points, and the duration
of his public ministry connects the second and third. The
results obtained under the different heads serve mutually to
test, and thereby to correct or confirm, one another.</p>

<p>1. The date of the Nativity as fixed according to our common
computation of Anni Domini (first put forward by Dionysius
Exiguus at Rome early in the 6th century) has long been recognized
to be too late. The fathers of the primitive church had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page888" id="page888"></a>888</span>
nearer the truth with the years 3 or 2 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (see Irenaeus, <i>Haer</i>.
111. xxi. 3 [xxiv. 2]; Clement of Alexandria, <i>Strom</i>. i. 21, p. 147;
Hippolytus, <i>in Danielem</i>, iv. ed. Bonwetsch, p. 242; [Tertullian],
<i>adv. Judaeos</i>, 8). What may be called the received chronology
during the last two centuries has pushed the date farther back
to 4 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> But the considerations now to be adduced make it
probable that the true date is earlier still.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Evidence of St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel</i> (i. 18-ii. 22).&mdash;The birth of
Christ took place before the death of Herod, and the evidence
of Josephus fixes the death of Herod, with some approach to
certainty, in the early spring of 4 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Josephus, indeed, while
he tells us that Herod died not long before Passover, nowhere
names the exact year; but he gives four calculations which serve
to connect Herod&rsquo;s death with more or less known points, namely,
the length of Herod&rsquo;s own reign, both from his <i>de jure</i> and from
his <i>de facto</i> accession, and the length of the reigns of two of his
successors, Archelaus and Herod Philip, to the date of their
deposition and death respectively. The various calculations
are not quite easy to harmonize, but the extent of choice for the
year of Herod&rsquo;s death is limited to the years 4 and 3 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, with a
very great preponderance of probability in favour of the former.
How long before this the Nativity should be placed the Gospel
does not enable us to say precisely, but as Herod&rsquo;s decree of
extermination included all infants up to two years of age, and as
a sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt of unknown length
intervened between the massacre and Herod&rsquo;s death, it is clear
that it is at least possible, so far as the evidence of this Gospel
goes, that the birth of Christ preceded Herod&rsquo;s death by as much
as two or three years. What is thus shown to be possible would,
of course, be necessary if we went on, with the astronomer
Kepler, to identify the star of the Magi with the conjunction of
the planets Jupiter and Saturn which occurred, in the constellation
Pisces, in May, October and December of 7 <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa58a" id="fa58a" href="#ft58a"><span class="sp">58</span></a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Evidence of St Luke&rsquo;s Gospel</i> (ii. 1-8).-The birth of Christ
took place at the time of a general census of the empire ordered
by Augustus: &ldquo;it was the first census, and was made at the
time when Quirinius was governor of Syria.&rdquo; Against this account
it has been urged that we know that the governorship of Syria
from 10 or 9 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> down to and after Herod&rsquo;s death was held
successively by M. Titius, C. Sentius Saturninus, and P. Quintilius
Varus; and further, that when Judaea became a Roman
province on the deposition of Archelaus in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 6, Quirinius was
governor of Syria, and did carry out an elaborate census. The
notice in the Gospel, it is suggested, grew out of a confused
recollection of the later (and only historical) census, and is
devoid of any value whatever. At the other extreme Sir W.
M. Ramsay (<i>Was Christ Born at Bethlehem?</i>, 1898, pp. 149 ff.)
defends the exact accuracy of St Luke&rsquo;s &ldquo;first census&rdquo; as witnessing
to the (otherwise of course unknown) introduction
into Syria of the periodic fourteen years&rsquo; census which the
evidence of papyri has lately established for Egypt, at least
from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 20 onwards. Reckoning back from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 20, the periodic
census should fall in 9 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but Ramsay alleges various causes
for delay, which would have postponed the actual execution
of the census till 7 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and supposes that Quirinius was an
imperial commissioner specially appointed to carry it out. The
truth seems to rest midway between these extremes. St Luke&rsquo;s
statement of a general census is in all probability erroneous,
and the introduction of the name Quirinius appears to be due
to confusion with the census of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 6. But the confusion in
question would only be possible, or at any rate likely, if there
really was a census at the time of the Nativity; and it is no more
improbable that Herod should have held, or permitted to be
held, a local census than that Archelaus of Cappadocia in the
reign of Tiberius (Tacitus, <i>Ann</i>. vi. 41) should have taken a
census of his own native state &ldquo;after the Roman manner.&rdquo;
But St Luke&rsquo;s account, when the name of Quirinius is subtracted
from it, ceases to contain any chronological evidence.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Evidence of Tertullian.</i>&mdash;Strangely enough, however,
the missing name of the governor under whom the census
of the Nativity was carried out appears to be supplied by an
author who wrote more than a century after St Luke, and has
by no means a good reputation for historical trustworthiness.
Tertullian, in fact (<i>adv. Marcionem</i>, iv. 19), employs against
Marcion&rsquo;s denial of the true humanity of Christ the argument
that it was well known that Sentius Saturninus carried out a
census under Augustus in Judaea, by consulting which the
family and relationships of Christ could have been discovered.
This Saturninus was the middle one of the three governors of
Syria named above, and as his successor Varus must have
arrived by the middle of 6 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> at latest (for coins of Varus are
extant of the twenty-fifth year of the era of Actium), his own
tenure must have fallen about 8 and 7 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and his census
cannot be placed later than 7 or 7-6 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The independence
of Tertullian&rsquo;s information about this census is guaranteed by
the mere fact of his knowledge of the governor&rsquo;s name; and if
there was a census about that date, it would be unreasonable
not to identify it with St Luke&rsquo;s census of the Nativity.</p>

<p>The traditional Western day for the Christmas festival, 25th
December, goes back as far as Hippolytus, <i>loc. cit</i>.; the traditional
Eastern day, 6th January, as far as the Basilidian
Gnostics (but in their case only as a celebration of the Baptism),
mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, <i>loc. cit</i>.</p>

<p>2. The interval between the Nativity and the Baptism.</p>

<p><i>Evidence of St Luke&rsquo;s Gospel</i> (iii. 23).&mdash;At the time of his
baptism Jesus was <span class="grk" title="archomenos osei etoi triakonta">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#8033;&#963;&#949;&#8054; &#7952;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span>, of which
words two opposite misinterpretations must be avoided: (i.)
<span class="grk" title="archomenos">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> does not mean (as Valentinian interpreters thought,
Iren. 11. xxii. 5 [xxxiii. 3]; so also Epiphanius, <i>Haer</i>. li. 16)
&ldquo;beginning to be thirty years&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;not yet quite
thirty,&rdquo; but &ldquo;at the beginning of His ministry,&rdquo; as in Luke
xxiii. 5; Acts i. 22, x. 37; (ii.) <span class="grk" title="osei etoi triakonta">&#8033;&#963;&#949;&#8054; &#7952;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> does not
mean &ldquo;on attaining the full age of thirty, before which he could
not have publicly taught,&rdquo; for if there was by Jewish custom or
tradition any minimum age for a teacher, it was not thirty, but
forty (<i>Bab. Talm</i>. ed. 1715, fol. 19 <i>b</i>; Iren. <i>loc cit</i>.). St Luke&rsquo;s
phrase is a general one, &ldquo;about thirty years old,&rdquo; and cannot
be so pressed as to exclude some latitude in either direction.</p>

<p>3. The date of the Baptism.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Evidence of St Luke&rsquo;s Gospel</i> (iii. 1).&mdash;A <i>terminus a quo</i>
for the Baptism is the synchronism of the commencement
of the Baptist&rsquo;s public ministry with the fifteenth year
of the rule (<span class="grk" title="aegemonia">&#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#945;</span>) of Tiberius. Augustus died on 19th
August <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 14, and, reckoned from that point, Tiberius&rsquo;s
fifteenth year might be, according to different methods of
calculation, either <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 28, or 28-29, or 29. But any such
result would be difficult to reconcile with the results yielded
by other lines of investigation in this article; among alternative
views the choice seems to lie between the following:&mdash;(i.)
The years of Tiberius are here reckoned from some
earlier starting-point than the death of his predecessor&mdash;probably
from the grant to him of co-ordinate authority with
Augustus over the provinces made in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 11 (see, for the parallel
with the case of Vespasian and Titus, Ramsay, <i>St Paul the
Roman Traveller</i>, p. 387), so that the fifteenth year would be
roughly <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 25; or (ii.) St Luke has made here a second error in
chronology, caused perhaps in this case by reckoning back from
the Crucifixion, and only allowing one year to the ministry of
Christ.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Evidence of St John&rsquo;s Gospel</i> (ii. 13, 20).&mdash;A <i>terminus ad
quem</i> for the Baptism is the synchronism of the first Passover
mentioned after it with the forty-sixth year of the building of
Herod&rsquo;s Temple. Herod began the Temple in the eighteenth
year of his reign, probably 20-19 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and the Passover of the
forty-sixth year is probably that of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 27. While too much
stress must not be laid on a chain of reasoning open to some
uncertainty at several points, it is difficult to suppose with Loisy,
<i>Quatrième Évangile</i>, 1903, p. 293, that the number was intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page889" id="page889"></a>889</span>
by the evangelist as purely figurative, and is therefore destitute
of all historical meaning.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Baptism of Christ should probably be placed
in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 26-27; and as the Nativity was placed in 7-6 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (at
latest), this would make the age of Christ at his Baptism to be
about thirty-two, which tallies well enough with St Luke&rsquo;s
general estimate.</p>

<p>4. The interval between the Baptism and the Crucifixion, or,
in other words, the duration of the public ministry of Christ.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Evidence of the Synoptic Tradition and of St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel</i>
(ii. 23, vi. 39, xiv. 1).&mdash;The order of events in the primitive
synoptic tradition appears to be faithfully reproduced in St
Mark; and if this order is chronological, Christ&rsquo;s ministry lasted
at least two years, since the plucking of the ears of corn (April-June)
marks a first spring; the feeding of the five thousand
when the grass was fresh green (<span class="grk" title="chloros">&#967;&#955;&#969;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span>: about March), a second;
and the Passover of the Crucifixion a third: and these three
points are so far removed from one another in the narrative that
the conclusion would hold, even if the general arrangement in
St Mark were only roughly, and not minutely, chronological.
On the other hand, it may be true that an impression of a briefer
period of ministry naturally results, and in early generations did
actually result, from the synoptic account considered as a whole.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Evidence of St Luke&rsquo;s Gospel</i> (ix. 51-xix. 28 compared with
iv. 14-ix. 50; iv. 19).&mdash;Still stronger is the impression of brevity
suggested by St Luke. The second and larger half of the narrative
of the ministry is introduced at ix. 51 with the words, &ldquo;It came
to pass as the days of His assumption were coming to the full, He
set His face firmly to go to Jerusalem,&rdquo; under which phrase the
evangelist cannot have meant to include more than a few months,
perhaps not more than a few weeks; so that even if the earlier
and shorter half of the account, which describes a purely Galilean
ministry (&ldquo;Judaea&rdquo; in iv. 44, if it is the true reading, means
Judaea in the sense of Palestine), is to be spread over a longer
period of time, the combined narrative can hardly have been
planned on the scale of more than a single year. St Luke himself
may have understood literally, like so many of his readers in
ancient times, the reference which he records to the &ldquo;acceptable
year of the Lord&rdquo; (iv. 19 = Isaiah lxi. 2): see, too, above, 3 (<i>a</i>)
<i>ad fin</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Evidence of St John&rsquo;s Gospel</i> (ii. 13, &ldquo;the Passover of the
Jews was near,&rdquo; and 23, &ldquo;He was in Jerusalem at the Passover at
the feast&rdquo;; v. 1, &ldquo;after these things was a feast [or &lsquo;the feast&rsquo;]
of the Jews&rdquo;; vi. 4, &ldquo;and the Passover, the feast of the Jews,
was near&rdquo;; vii. 2, &ldquo;and the feast of the Jews, the Tabernacles,
was near&rdquo;; x. 22, &ldquo;at that time the feast of dedication took
place at Jerusalem&rdquo;; xi. 55, &ldquo;and the Passover of the Jews was
near&rdquo;: besides iv. 35, &ldquo;say ye not that there is yet a period of
four months and harvest cometh? behold, I tell you, lift up
your eyes and see the fields that they are white to harvest&rdquo;).
This catena of time-references is of course unique in the Gospels
as a basis for a chronology of the ministry; and it is not reasonable
to doubt (with Loisy, <i>loc. cit</i>., who suggests that the aim was
to produce an artificial correspondence of a three and a half years&rsquo;
ministry with the half-week of Daniel; but many and diverse as
are the early interpretations of Daniel&rsquo;s seventy weeks, no one
before Eusebius thought of connecting the half-week with the
ministry), that the evangelist intended these notices as definite
historical <i>data</i>, possibly for the correction of the looser synoptic
narratives and of the erroneous impressions to which they had
given rise. Unfortunately, difficulties, either (i.) of reading, or
(ii.) of interpretation, or (iii.) of arrangement, have been raised
with regard to nearly all of them; and these difficulties must be
briefly noticed here.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(i.) <i>Readings</i> (&alpha;) v. 1. <span class="grk" title="eortae">&#7953;&#959;&#961;&#964;&#942;</span> A B D, Origen, Epiphanius, Chrysostom,
<i>Paschal Chronicle</i>; <span class="grk" title="ae eortae">&#7969; &#7953;&#959;&#961;&#964;&#942;</span> <span title="alef">&#1488;</span>CL&Delta; 1-118, 33, the Egyptian versions,
Eusebius, Cyril-Alex. (Irenaeus?). The balance of internal evidence&mdash;copyists
being more likely to accentuate than to diminish the
precision of a note of time&mdash;inclines, like the balance of external
evidence, against the article, (&beta;) vi. 4, <span class="grk" title="to pascha">&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#945;</span> is read by all known
MSS. and versions; but it has been argued by Hort (in Westcott&rsquo;s
and Hort&rsquo;s <i>New Testament in Greek</i>, appendix, pp. 77-81) that four
ancient authorities omitted the words, and that their omission
simplifies the whole chronology, since &ldquo;the feast&rdquo; which was
&ldquo;near&rdquo; in vi. 4 would then be identical with the feast of Tabernacles
mentioned in vii. 2, and all the time-notices of the Gospel could be
arranged to fall within the space of a single year, between the Passover
of ii. 13 and the Passover of xi. 55. But of the four authorities
alleged, Irenaeus (11. xxii. 3 [xxxiii. i]) and the Alogi (<i>ap</i>. Epiphanius,
<i>Haer</i>. li. 22) were giving catalogues of Passovers &ldquo;observed&rdquo; by
Christ (at Jerusalem), and therefore naturally omitted a mere
chronological reference like vi. 4: Cyril of Alexandria, in so far as
his evidence is adverse to the words, appears to be incorporating
a passage from the <i>Commentary</i> of Origen, not extant <i>in loc</i>.; and
the only writer who perhaps really did omit the words&mdash;with the
view, no doubt, of reconciling the witness of the fourth Gospel with
the then widely spread tradition of the single-year ministry&mdash;is
Origen himself.</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>Interpretation</i> (&alpha;) iv. 35: which is to be taken literally, the
&ldquo;four months to harvest&rdquo; (about January), or the &ldquo;fields white to
harvest&rdquo; (about May)? It does not seem possible to rule out either
interpretation; the choice between them will follow from the view
taken of the general chronological arrangement of the Gospel.
(&beta;) v. i.: if &ldquo;the feast&rdquo; is read, a choice remains between Passover
and Tabernacles (the definite article would not be very definite after
all); if the more probable &ldquo;a feast,&rdquo; the greater feasts are presumably
excluded, but a choice remains between, at any rate, Pentecost
(May), Trumpets (September), Dedication (December) and Purim
(February). Here again the decision will follow on the general
chronological arrangement which may be adopted.</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>Arrangement.</i>&mdash;So far the amount of possible latitude left
is not so great as to obscure the main outline of the chronology.
For a first (ii. 13, 20), second (vi. 4), and third (xi. 55) Passover
are established, with two indeterminate notices (iv. 35, v. 1) between
the first and second, and two determinate notices (vii. 2 Tabernacles
in October, x. 22 Dedication in December) between the second and
third. But of late years an increasing desire has been manifested,
especially in Germany and America, to manipulate the fourth Gospel
on grounds of internal evidence, at first only in the way of particular
transpositions of more or less attractiveness, but latterly also by
schemes of thorough-going rearrangement. The former class of
proposals will as a rule hardly affect the chronology of the Gospel;
the latter will affect it vitally. The distinction here drawn may be
illustrated from the earliest instance of the former and one of the
latest of the latter. In 1871 Archdeacon J.P. Norris (<i>Journal of
Philology</i>) wished to transpose chapters v. and vi.&mdash;ch. vi. was, like
ch. xxi., a Galilean appendix, and was inserted by mistake at somewhat
too late a point in the body of the Gospel&mdash;and to read &ldquo;the
feast&rdquo; in v. 1, identifying it with the Passover which was near in
vi. 4: in any case, whether &ldquo;the feast&rdquo; = Passover, or &ldquo;a feast&rdquo; = Pentecost,
were read in v. 1, the transposition would not affect
the two years&rsquo; ministry. In 1900 Professor B.W. Bacon (<i>American
Journal of Theology</i>, p. 770) proposed a rearrangement of the whole
Gospel, according to which the time-notices would occur in the
following order: vi. 4, Passover is near; iv. 35, the fields white
to harvest = May; v. 1, &ldquo;a feast&rdquo; = Pentecost; vii. 2, Tabernacles;
x. 22, Dedication; xi. 55, Passover is near; xii. 1, Jesus at Bethany
six days before Passover; ii. 13, Passover is near and Jesus goes up
to Jerusalem (ii. 23, an interpolation) for the Passover of the Crucifixion;
and the ministry would thus be reduced to a single year.
Such a scheme does not lend itself to discussion here; but as far as
evidence is at present obtainable, the conclusion that the fourth
evangelist drew up his narrative on the basis of a two years&rsquo; rather
than a one year&rsquo;s ministry appears to be irrefragable.</p>
</div>

<p>Not only do the fourth and second Gospels thus agree in
indications of a two years&rsquo; ministry, but the notes of the middle
spring of the three (John vi. 4; Mark vi. 39) both belong to the
feeding of the 5000, one of the few points of actual contact
Detween the two Gospels.</p>

<p>The question, however, may still be raised, whether these
time-indications of the two Gospels are exhaustive, whether
(that is) two years, and two years only, are to be allotted to the
ministry. Irenaeus (ii. xxii. 3-6 [xxxiii. 1-4]), in favour of a
ministry of not less than ten years, appeals (i.) to the tradition
of Asia Minor; (ii.) to the record in St John that Christ, who was
thirty years old at the time of his baptism, was addressed by
the Jews as &ldquo;not yet [<i>i.e</i>. nearly] fifty years old&rdquo;: but both his
arguments are probably derived from a single source, Papias&rsquo;s
interpretation of John viii. 57. With this exception, however,
all ancient writers, whether they enumerated two or three or
four Passovers in the Gospel history, believed that the enumeration
was exhaustive; and their belief appears correctly to represent
the mind of the author of the Fourth Gospel, seeing that his
various notes of time were probably in intentional contrast to the
looser synoptic accounts. Moreover, the wide currency in early
times of the tradition of the single-year ministry (Ptolemaeus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page890" id="page890"></a>890</span>
<i>ap.</i> Iren, <i>loc. cit.</i>; <i>Clementine Homilies</i>, xvii. 19;
Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> i. 145, vi. 279;
Julius Africanus, <i>ap.</i> Routh, <i>Rell. Sacr.</i> ii. 240, 306;
Hippolytus, <i>Paschal Cycle</i> and <i>Chronicle</i>;
Origen, <i>in Levit. Hom.</i> ix. 5, <i>de Principiis</i>, iv. 5)
becomes more difficult to account for the farther it is removed from the
actual facts.</p>

<p>5. The date of the Crucifixion.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The Roman Governor.</i>&mdash;Pontius Pilate was on his way back
to Rome, after ten years of office, when Tiberius died on the 16th
March <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 37 (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> XVIII. ii. 2, iv. 2). Luke xiii. 1,
xxiii. 12, show that he was not a newcomer at the time of the
Crucifixion. For the Crucifixion &ldquo;under Pontius Pilate&rdquo; the
Passover of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 28 is therefore the earliest possible and the
Passover of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 36 the latest.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Jewish High-Priest.</i>&mdash;Caiaphas was appointed before
Pilate&rsquo;s arrival, and was deposed at a Passover apparently not
later than that of the year of Herod Philip&rsquo;s death, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 34
(Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> XVIII. ii. 2, iv. 3-v. 3). The Crucifixion at some
previous Passover would then fall not later than <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 33.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Day of the Week.</i>&mdash;The Resurrection on &ldquo;the first
day of the week&rdquo; (Sunday) was &ldquo;on the third day&rdquo; after the
Crucifixion; and that &ldquo;the third day&rdquo; implies an interval of
only two days hardly needed to be shown, but has been shown
to demonstration in Field&rsquo;s <i>Notes on the Translation of the New
Testament</i> (on Matt. xvi. 21). The Crucifixion was therefore
on a Friday in some year between <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 28 and 33 inclusive.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The Day of the Jewish Month Nisan.</i>&mdash;The Passover was
kept at the full moon of the lunar month Nisan, the first of the
Jewish ecclesiastical year; the Paschal lambs were slain on the
afternoon of the 14th Nisan, and the Passover was eaten after
sunset the same day&mdash;which, however, as the Jewish day began
at sunset, was by their reckoning the early hours of the 15th
Nisan; the first fruits (of the barley harvest) were solemnly
offered on the 16th. The synoptic Gospels <i>appear</i> to place the
Crucifixion on the 15th, since they speak of the Last Supper as
a Passover;<a name="fa59a" id="fa59a" href="#ft59a"><span class="sp">59</span></a> St John&rsquo;s Gospel, on the other hand (xiii. 1, 29,
xviii. 28), distinctly implies that the feast had not yet taken
place, and thus makes the Crucifixion fall on the 14th.
Early Christian tradition is unanimous on this side; either the 14th
is mentioned, or the Crucifixion is made the antitype of the
slaughter of the Paschal Lamb (and the Resurrection of the first
fruits), in the following authorities anterior to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 235: St Paul,
1 Cor. v. 7, xv. 20; Quartodecimans of Asia Minor, who observed
the Christian Pascha on the &ldquo;14th,&rdquo; no matter on what day of
the week it fell; Claudius Apollinaris, Clement of Alexandria,
Hippolytus, all three quoted in the <i>Paschal Chronicle</i>; Irenaeus
(apparently) iv. x. 1 [xx. 1]; [Tertullian] <i>adv. Judaeos</i>, 8;
Africanus, in Routh, <i>Rell. Sacr.</i> ii. 297. The Crucifixion, then,
should be placed rather on the 14th than on the 15th of Nisan.</p>

<p>These four lines of inquiry have shown that the Crucifixion
fell on Friday, Nisan 14 (rather than 15), in one of the six years
28-33 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>; and therefore, if it is possible to discover (i.) exactly
which moon or month was reckoned each year as the moon or
month of Nisan, and (ii.) exactly on what day that particular
moon or month was reckoned as beginning, it will, of course, be
possible to tell in which of these years Nisan 14 fell on a Friday.
To neither question can an answer be given in terms so precise
as to exclude some latitude, but to both with sufficient exactness
to rule out at once three of the six years. (i.) The difficulty with
regard to the month is to know how the commencement of the
Jewish year was fixed&mdash;in what years an extra month was intercalated
before Nisan. If the Paschal full moon was, as in later
Christian times, the first after the spring equinox, the difficulty
would be reduced to the question on what day the equinox was
reckoned. If, on the other hand, it was, as in ancient Jewish
times, the first after the earliest ears of the barley harvest would
be ripe, it would have varied with the forwardness or backwardness
of the season from year to year. (ii.) The difficulty with
regard to the day is, quite similarly, to know what precise relation
the first day of the Jewish month bore to the astronomical new
moon. In later Christian times the Paschal month was calculated
from the astronomical new moon; in earlier Jewish times all
months were reckoned to begin at the first sunset when the new
moon was visible, which in the most favourable circumstances
would be some hours, and in the most unfavourable three days,
later than the astronomical new moon.</p>

<p>Direct material for answering the question when and how far
astronomical calculations replaced simple observations as the
basis of the Jewish calendar is not forthcoming. Jewish traditions
represented the Sanhedrin as retaining to the end its
plenary power over the calendar, and as still fixing the first day
of every month and the first month of every year. But as it is
quite inconceivable that the Jews of the Dispersion should not
have known beforehand at what full moon they were to
present themselves at Jerusalem for the Passover, it must be
assumed as true in fact, whether or no it was true in theory,
that the old empirical methods must have been qualified, at
least partially, by permanent, that is in effect by astronomical
rules. Exactly what modifications were first made in the system
under which each month began by simple observation of the
new moon we do not know, and opinions are not agreed as to
the historical value of the rabbinical traditions; but probably
the first step in the direction of astronomical precision would
be the rule that no month could consist of less than twenty-nine
or more than thirty days&mdash;to which appears to have been added,
but at what date is uncertain, the further rule that Adar, the
month preceding Nisan, was always to be limited to twenty-nine.
In the same way the beginning of the Jewish year according
to the state of the harvest was supplanted by some more fixed
relation to the solar year. But this relation was not, it would
seem, regulated by the date, real or supposed, of the equinox.
Christian controversialists from Anatolius of Laodicea (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 277)
onwards accused the Jews of disregarding the (Christian)
equinoctial limit, and of sometimes placing the Paschal full moon
before it; and it is possible that in the time of Christ the 14th
of Nisan might have fallen as far back as the 17th of March.
In the following table the first column gives the <i>terminus
paschalis</i>, or 14th of the Paschal moon, according to the Christian
calendar; the second gives the 14th, reckoned from the time
of the astronomical new moon of Nisan; the third the 14th,
reckoned from the probable first appearance of the new moon
at sunset. Alternative moons are given for <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29, according
as the full moon falling about the 18th of March is or is not
reckoned the proper Paschal moon.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once that Friday cannot have fallen on Nisan
14th in any of the three years <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 28, 31 and 32. The choice is
narrowed down to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29, Friday, 18th March (Friday, 15th
April, would no doubt be too early even for the 14th of Nisan);
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 30, Friday 7th April; and <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 33, Friday, 3rd April.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The Civil Year</i> (consuls, or regnal years of Tiberius) in early
Christian tradition. It is not <i>a priori</i> improbable that the year
of the central event from which the Christian Church dated her
own existence should have been noted in the apostolic age
and handed down to the memory of succeeding generations;
and the evidence does go some way to suggest that we have in
favour of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29, the consulate of the two Gemini (15th or 16th
year of Tiberius), a body of tradition independent of the Gospels
and ancient, if not primitive, in origin.</p>

<p>The earliest witness, indeed, who can be cited for a definite
date for the crucifixion gave not 29, but 33 <span class="scs">A.D.</span> The pagan
chronicler, Phlegon, writing in the reign of Hadrian, noted
under Olympiad 202.4 (= <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 32-33), besides a great earthquake
in Bithynia, an eclipse so remarkable that it became night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page891" id="page891"></a>891</span>
&ldquo;at the sixth hour of the day.&rdquo; The eclipse meant is, presumably,
that of the Crucifixion (so Origen, <i>contra Celsum</i>,, ii. 33
[but see <i>in Matt</i>. 134, Delarue iii. 922], Eusebius&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i>
Tib. 19 [= <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 33], Anon, in Cramer&rsquo;s <i>Catena in Matt</i>. p. 237),
but as the notice of it was clearly derived by Phlegon, pagan as
he was, directly or indirectly from the Gospel narrative, there is
no reason at all to ascribe any independent value to the date.
Phlegon may have had grounds for dating the Bithynian earthquake
in that year, and have brought the dateless portent into
connexion with the dated one. Eusebius adopted and popularized
this date, which fell in with his own system of Gospel chronology,
but of the year 33 as the date of the Passion there is
no vestige in Christian tradition before the 4th century.</p>

<p>The only date, in fact, which has any real claim to represent
Christian tradition independent of the Gospels, is the year 29.
Tiberius 15 is given by Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> i. 147; Origen,
<i>Hom. in Jerem.</i> xiv. 13; cf. <i>c.</i> <i>Cels.</i> iv. 22. Tiberius 16 by
Julius Africanus (Routh, <i>Rell. Sacr.</i> ii. 301-304), and pseudo-Cyprian
<i>de pascha computus</i> (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 243), § 20. The consulship
of the two Gemini by Lactantius, <i>Div. Inst.</i> iv. x. 18, and
(Lactantius?) <i>de morte pers.</i> § 2; the consulship of the two
Gemini = Tiberius 18 by Hippolytus, <i>Comm. in Danielem</i>, iv.
(ed. Bonwetsch, p. 242); the consulship of the two Gemini =
Tiberius 15 by [Tertullian] <i>adv. Judaeos</i>, § 8; the consulship of
the two Gemini = Tiberius 15 (<i>al.</i> 18 or 19) = Ol. 202.4 [this
last is a later interpolation from Eusebius] in the <i>Acts of Pilate</i>.
Other methods of expressing the year 29 appear in Hippolytus&rsquo;s
<i>Paschal Cycle</i> and <i>Chronicle</i>, and in the Abgar legend (<i>ap.</i>
Eusebius, <i>H.E.</i> i. 13). No doubt it would be possible to explain
Tiberius 16 as a combination of Luke iii. 1 with a one-year
ministry, and even to treat Tiberius 15 as an unintelligent
repetition from St Luke&mdash;though the omission to allow a single
year for the ministry would be so strange as to be almost unintelligible&mdash;but
the date by the consuls has an independent look about it, and of
its extreme antiquity the evidence gives
two indications: (i.) Hippolytus&rsquo;s Commentary on Daniel (now
generally dated <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200) combines it with an apparently
inconsistent date, Tiberius 18; the latter is clearly his own
combination of the length of the ministry (he says in the same
passage that Christ suffered in his 33rd year) with Luke iii.
1&mdash;the consulship must have been taken from tradition without
regard to consistency; (ii.) the names of the Gemini are divergently
given in our oldest authorities; in [Tert.] <i>adv. Judaeos</i>
correctly as Rubellius Geminus and Fufius (or Rufius) Geminus,
but in Hippolytus and the <i>Acts of Pilate</i> as Rufus and Rubellio.
But if the tradition of the consulship was thus, it would seem,
already an old one about the year 200, there is at least some reason
to conclude that trustworthy information in early Christian
circles pointed, independently of the Gospels, to the year 29
as that of the Crucifixion.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>The Civil Month and Day.</i>&mdash;The earliest known calculations,
by Basilidian Gnostics, quoted in Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> i. 147,
gave alternative dates, Phamenoth 25, Pharmuthi 25, Pharmuthi
19; that is, according to the fixed Alexandrine calendar of
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> 26, 21st March, 20th April, 14th April; in the older,
not wholly superseded, Egyptian calendar the equivalents
with Roman days varied from year to year. But in all
probability these dates were only one development of those
speculations in the region of numbers to which Gnosticism was
so prone; and in any case to look for genuine traditions among
Egyptian Gnostics, or even in the church of Alexandria, would
be to misread the history of Christianity in the 2nd century.
Such traditions must be found, if anywhere, in Palestine and
Syria, in Asia Minor, in Rome, not in Egypt; within the Church,
not among the Gnostics. The date which makes the most
obvious claim to satisfy these conditions would be the 25th of
March, as given by Hippolytus, [Tert.] <i>adv. Judaeos</i>, and the
<i>Acts of Pilate</i> (according to all extant MSS. and versions, but
see below), <i>locc. citt.</i>&mdash;the same three authorities who bear the
earliest witness for the consuls of the year of the Crucifixion&mdash;and
by many later writers. It cannot be correct, since no full
moon occurs near it in any of the possible years; yet it must be very
early, too early to be explained with Dr Salmon (<i>Dictionary
of Christian Biography</i>, iii. 92<i>b</i>), as originated by Hippolytus&rsquo;s
Paschal cycle of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 221. Now Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> l. 1) had
seen copies of the <i>Acts of Pilate</i> in which the day given was
not 25th March, but <i>a.d. xv. kal. Apr.</i> (= 18th March); and
if this was the primitive form of the tradition, it is easy to
see how 25th March could have grown out of it, since the
18th would from comparatively early times, in the East at any
rate, have been thought impossible as falling before the equinox,
and no substitution would be so natural as that of the day
week, Friday, 25th March. But Friday, 18th March, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29,
was one of the three alternative dates for the Crucifixion which on
astronomical and calendar grounds were found (see above, 5<i>d</i>)
to be possible.</p>

<p>Thus <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29 is the year, the 18th of March is the day, to which
Christian tradition (whatever value, whether much or little,
be ascribed to it) appears to point. Further, the Baptism was
tentatively placed in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 26-27; the length of the ministry
was fixed, with some approach to certainty, at between two and
three years, and here too the resultant date for the Crucifixion
would be the Passover of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29.</p>

<p>To sum up: the various dates and intervals, to the approximate
determination of which this article has been devoted, do
not claim separately more than a tentative and probable value.
But it is submitted that their harmony and convergence give
them some additional claim to acceptance, and at any rate
do something to secure each one of them singly&mdash;the Nativity
in 7-6 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the Baptism in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 26-27, the Crucifixion in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29&mdash;from being to any wide extent in error.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>The Chronology of the Apostolic Age.</i></p>

<p>The chronology of the New Testament outside the Gospels may
be defined for the purposes of this article as that of the period
between the Crucifixion in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29 (30) on the one hand, and on
the other the persecution of Nero in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 64 and the fall of Jerusalem
in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70. Of the events in Christian history which fall
between these limits it must be admitted that there are many
which with our present information we cannot date with exactness.
But the book of Acts, our only continuous authority for
the period, contains two synchronisms with secular history
which can be dated with some pretence to exactness and constitute
fixed points by help of which a more or less complete chronology can
be constructed for at least the latter half of the
apostolic age. These are the death of Herod Agrippa I. (xii. 23)
and the replacement of Felix by Festus (xxiv. 27).</p>

<p>1. The death of Herod Agrippa I. This prince, son of Aristobulus
and grandson of Herod the Great, was made (i.) king
over the tetrarchy which had been Herod Philip&rsquo;s, &ldquo;not many
days&rdquo; after the accession of Gaius, 16th of March <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 37; (ii.)
ruler of the tetrarchy of Antipas, in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 39-40; (iii.) ruler of the
whole of Palestine (with Abilene), on the accession of Claudius
at the beginning of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 41. Josephus&rsquo;s <i>Jewish Wars</i> and <i>Antiquities</i>
differ by one in the number of years they allot to his reign
over the tetrarchies (the former work says three years, the latter
four), but agree in the more important <i>datum</i> that he reigned
three years more after the grant from Claudius, which would
make the latest limit of his death the spring of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44. The
<i>Antiquities</i> also place his death in the seventh year of his reign,
which would be <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 43-44. On the other hand, coins whose
genuineness there is no apparent reason to doubt are extant
of Agrippa&rsquo;s ninth year; and this can only be reconciled even
with <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44 by supposing that he commenced reckoning a second
year of his reign on Nisan 1, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 37, so that his ninth would
run from Nisan 1, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44. On the balance of evidence the only
year which can possibly reconcile all the data appears to be
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44 after Nisan, so that it will have been at the Passover
of that year that St Peter&rsquo;s arrest and deliverance took
place.</p>

<p>After Agrippa&rsquo;s death Judaea was once more governed by
procurators, of whom Cuspius Fadus and Tiberius Alexander
ruled from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44 to 48; the third, Cumanus, was appointed in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 48; and the fourth, Felix, in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 52. Under Tiberius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page892" id="page892"></a>892</span>
Alexander, <i>i.e.</i> in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 46 or 47, occurred the great famine which
Agabus had foretold, and in which the Antiochene church sent
help to that of Jerusalem by the ministry of Barnabas and Saul
(Acts xi. 30, xii. 25). Thus the earliest date at which the commencement
of the first missionary journey (Acts xiii. 4) can be
placed is the spring of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 47. The journey extended from
Salamis &ldquo;throughout the whole island&rdquo; of Cyprus as far as
Paphos, and on the mainland from Pamphylia to Pisidian
Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and Derbe, at each of which places
indications are given of a prolonged visit (xiii. 49, xiv. 3, 6, 7, 21).
The same places were visited in reverse order on the return
journey, as far as Perga on the Pamphylian coast; but instead
of revisiting Cyprus the voyage to Syria was this time made
direct. In estimating the length of time occupied by this first
missionary journey, it must be remembered that a sea voyage
could never have been undertaken, and land travel only rarely,
during the winter months, say November to March; and as the
amount of the work accomplished is obviously more than could
fall within the travelling season of a single year, the winter of
47-48 must have been spent in the interior, and return to the
coast and to Syria made only some time before the end of
autumn <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 48. The succeeding winter, at least, was spent
again at Antioch of Syria (xiv. 28). The council at Jerusalem
of Acts xv. will fall at earliest in the spring of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 49, and as
only &ldquo;certain days&rdquo; were spent at Antioch after it (xv. 36) the
start on the second missionary journey might have been made
in the (late) summer of the same year. The &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo;
of the existing churches of Syria and Cilicia, and of those of the
first journey beginning with Derbe (xv. 41, xvi. 5), cannot have
been completed under several months, nor would the Apostle
have commenced the strictly missionary part of the journey in
districts not previously visited, before the opening of the travelling
season of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 50. No delay was then made on the Asiatic
side: it may still have been in spring when St Paul crossed to
Europe and began the course of preaching at Philippi, Thessalonica,
Beroea and Athens which finally brought him to Corinth.
The stay of eighteen months at the last-named place (xviii. 11)
will naturally begin at the end of one travelling season and end
at the beginning of another, <i>i.e.</i> from the autumn of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 50
to the spring of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 52. From Corinth the Apostle went to
Jerusalem to &ldquo;salute the church,&rdquo; and then again to Antioch
in Syria, where he stayed only for &ldquo;a time&rdquo; (xviii. 22), and soon
left&mdash;on the third missionary journey, as conventionally reckoned&mdash;proceeding
&ldquo;in order&rdquo; through the churches of the interior
of Asia Minor. These journeys and the intervening halts must
have occupied seven or eight months, and it must have been
about the end of the year when St Paul established his new
headquarters at Ephesus. The stay there lasted between two
and three years (xix. 8, 10, xx, 31), and cannot have terminated
before the spring of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 55. From Ephesus he went into Europe,
and after &ldquo;much teaching&rdquo; given to the churches of Macedonia
(xx. 2), spent the three winter months at Corinth, returning
to Philippi in time for the Passover (xx. 3, 6) of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 56. Pentecost
of the same year was spent at Jerusalem, and there St Paul
was arrested, and kept in prison at Caesarea for two full years,
until Festus succeeded Felix as governor (xx. 16, xxiv. 27), an
event which, on this arrangement of the chronology of the
missionary journeys, would therefore fall in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 58.</p>

<p>Care, however, must be taken to remember exactly what this
line of argument amounts to&mdash;what it can fairly be said to have
proved, and what it still leaves open. It has been shown, firstly,
that the missionary journeys cannot have commenced before
the spring of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 47, and, secondly, that between their commencement
and the end of the two years&rsquo; imprisonment at
Caesarea not less than eleven full years must have elapsed.
Consequently <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 58 appears to be the earliest date possible for
the arrival of Festus. On the other hand, a later date for Festus
is not absolutely excluded. It is possible that the first missionary
journey should be placed in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 48 instead of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 47; and
it is possible, though not probable, that the missionary journeys
should be spread over one year more than has been suggested
above. At any rate, then, the alternative is open that every
date given above, from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 47 to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 58, should be moved on
one year, with the result of placing Festus&rsquo;s arrival in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 50.</p>

<p>It is now time to run to the direct evidence for the date of
Festus&rsquo;s arrival as procurator, in order to test by it the result
already tentatively obtained.</p>

<p>2. The replacement of Felix by Festus. This is the pivot date
of St Paul&rsquo;s later life, but unfortunately two schools of critics
date it as differently as <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 55 and <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 60 (or 61). The former
are represented by Harnack, the latter by Wieseler, whom
Lightfoot follows. It can be said confidently that the truth is
between these two extremes (though in what exact year it is not
easy to say), as will be evident from a consideration of the arguments
urged, which in each case appear less to prove one extreme
than to disprove its opposite.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Arguments for the Later Date, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 60 or 61.</i>&mdash;(&alpha;) St Paul, at the
time of his arrest, two years before Felix&rsquo;s recall, addresses him as
&ldquo;for many years past a judge for this nation&rdquo; (Acts xxiv. 10, 27).
It is certain that Felix succeeded Cumanus in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 52, for Tacitus
mentions Cumanus&rsquo;s recall under that year, Josephus immediately
before the notice of the completion of Claudius&rsquo;s twelfth year
[January, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 53], Eusebius probably under Claudius II, that is,
between September 51 and September 52 (for the meaning of the
regnal years in the <i>Chronicle</i> of Eusebius see the present writer&rsquo;s
article in <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i>, January 1900, pp. 188-192).
It is argued that &ldquo;many years&rdquo; cannot mean less than six or seven,
so that St Paul must have been speaking at earliest in 58 or 59, and
Felix will have left Judaea at earliest in 60 or 61. But this argument
overlooks the fact that Felix had been in some position which might
properly be described as that of &ldquo;judge for this nation&rdquo; before he
became governor of all Palestine in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 52. In the words of Tacitus,
Felix was at the time of that appointment <i>iampridem Iudaeae impositus</i>
(<i>Annals</i>, xii. 54); he certainly supposes Felix to have been
already governor of Samaria, and apparently of Judaea too, and
only recognizes Cumanus as governor of Galilee; and Josephus,
though he says nothing of this, and treats Cumanus as the sole
procurator down to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 52, implies that Felix had been in some
position where the Jewish authorities could judge of his fitness when
he tells us that the high priest Jonathan used to press on Felix, as
a reason for urging him to govern well, the fact he that had asked
for his appointment to the procuratorship (<i>Ant.</i> xx. viii. 5). If
Felix had acted in some position of responsibility in Palestine before
52 (perhaps for some time before), St Paul could well have spoken
of &ldquo;many years&rdquo; at least as early as 56 or 57.</p>

<p>(&beta;)  Josephus enumerates after the accession of Nero (October 54)
a long catalogue of events which all took place under the procuratorship
of Felix, including the revolt of &ldquo;the Egyptian&rdquo; which was
already &ldquo;before these days&rdquo; at the time of St Paul&rsquo;s arrest, two
years from the end of Felix&rsquo;s tenure. This suggests, no doubt, that
the Egyptian rebelled at earliest in 54-55, and makes it probable
that St Paul&rsquo;s arrest did not take place before (the Pentecost of)
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 56; and it implies certainly that the main or most important
part of Felix&rsquo;s governorship fell, in Josephus&rsquo;s view, under Nero.
But as two years only of Felix&rsquo;s rule (52-54) fell under Claudius,
this procedure would be quite natural on Josephus&rsquo;s part if his recall
were dated in 58 or 59, so that four or five years fell under Nero.
And there is no need at all to suppose that all the incidents which
the historian masses under his account of Felix were successive:
events in Emesa, Chalcis, Caesarea and Jerusalem may easily have
been synchronous.</p>

<p>The arguments, then, brought forward in favour of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 60 or 61
do not do more than bring the rule of Felix down to 58 or 59.</p>

<p><i>Arguments for an Early Date, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 55 or 56.</i>&mdash;(&alpha;) Eusebius&rsquo;s
<i>Chronicle</i> places the arrival of Festus in Nero 2, October 55-56, and
Eusebius&rsquo;s chronology of the procurators goes back probably through
Julius Africanus (himself a Palestinian) to contemporary authorities
like the <i>Jewish kings</i> of Justus of Tiberias. But (i.) Nero 2 is really
September 56-September 57; (ii.) it is doubtful whether Eusebius
had any authority to depend on here other than Josephus, who gives
no precise year for Festus&mdash;Julius Africanus is hardly probable, since
we know that his chronicle was very jejune for the Christian period&mdash;and
if so, Eusebius had to find a year as best he could.<a name="fa60a" id="fa60a" href="#ft60a"><span class="sp">60</span></a></p>

<p>(&beta;) Felix, on his return to Rome, was prosecuted by the Jews for
misgovernment, but was acquitted through the influence of his
brother Pallas. Pallas had been minister and favourite of Claudius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page893" id="page893"></a>893</span>
but was removed from office in the winter following Nero&rsquo;s accession,
54-55. Felix must therefore have been tried at the very beginning
of Nero&rsquo;s reign. But this argument would make Felix&rsquo;s recall&mdash;if
Festus came in summer, as Acts xxv. 1, xxvii. 1, 9, seem to prove&mdash;to
fall actually under Claudius. And, in fact, it would be a mistake
look upon Pallas&rsquo;s retirement as a disgrace. He stipulated that
no inquiry should be made into his conduct in office, and was left
for another seven years unmolested in the enjoyment of the fortune
he had amassed. There is, therefore, every likelihood that he retained
for some years enough influence to shield his brother.</p>

<p>Of these arguments, then, the first, so far as it is valid, is an
argument for the summer, not of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 55 or 56, but of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 57 as that
of the recall, while the second will apply to any of the earlier
years of Nero&rsquo;s reign.</p>
</div>

<p>In the result, then, the arguments brought forward in favour
of each extreme fail to prove their case, but at the same time
prove something against the opposite view. Thus the point that
Josephus catalogues the events of Felix&rsquo;s procuratorship under
Nero cannot be pressed to bring down Felix&rsquo;s tenure as far as
60 or 61, but it does seem to exclude as early a termination as
56, or even 57. Conversely, the influence of Pallas at court need
not be terminated by his ceasing to be minister early in 55; but
it would have been overshadowed not later than the year 60
by the influence of Poppaea, who in the summer of that year<a name="fa61a" id="fa61a" href="#ft61a"><span class="sp">61</span></a>
enabled the Jews to win their cause in the matter of the Temple
wall, and would certainly have supported them against Felix.
Thus the choice again appears to lie between the years 58 and
59 for the recall of Felix and arrival of Festus.</p>

<p>If St Paul was arrested in 56 or 57, and appealed to Caesar on
the arrival of Festus in 58 or 59, then, as he reached Rome in the
early part of the year following, and remained there a prisoner
for two full years, we are brought down to the early spring of
either 61 or 62 for the close of the period recorded in the Acts.
That after these two years he was released and visited Spain in
the west, and in the east Ephesus, Macedonia, Crete, Troas,
Miletus, and perhaps Achaea and Epirus, is probable, in the one
case, from the evidence of Romans xv. 28, Clem. <i>ad Cor</i>. v. and
the Muratorian canon, and, in the other, from the Pastoral
Epistles. These journeys certainly cannot have occupied less
than two years, and it is more natural to allow three for them,
which takes us down to 64-65.</p>

<p>Early evidence is unanimous in pointing to St Peter and St
Paul as victims of the persecution of Nero (Clem, <i>ad Cor</i>. v. vi.,
Dionysius of Corinth <i>ap</i>. Eus. <i>H.E</i>. ii. 25, &amp;c., combined with
what we know from Tacitus of the course of the persecution, and
from Gaius of Rome, <i>ap</i>. Eus. ii. 25, of the burial-places of the
two apostles); and tradition clearly distinguished the fierce
outbreak at Rome that followed on the fire of the city in July 64
from any permanent disabilities of the Christians in the eye of
the law which the persecution may have initiated. There is,
therefore, no reason at all to doubt that both apostles were
martyred in 64-65, and the date serves as a confirmation of the
chronology adopted above of the imprisonment, release and
subsequent journeys of St Paul.</p>

<p>Investigation, then, of that part of the book of Acts which
follows the death of Agrippa, recorded in chap. xii.&mdash;<i>i.e</i>.
of that part of the apostolic age which follows the year 44&mdash;has shown
that apparent difficulties can be to a large extent set aside, and
that there is nowhere room between <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44 and 64 for doubt
extending to more than a single year. The first missionary
journey may have begun in 47 or 48; the arrival of Festus may
have taken place in the summer of 58 or of 59; the two years of
the Roman imprisonment recorded in the last chapter of Acts
may have ended in the spring of 61 or 62; and the dates which
fall in between these extremes are liable to the same variation.
The present writer leans to the earlier alternative in each case,
47, 58, 61; but he willingly concedes that the evidence, as he
understands it, is not inconsistent with the later alternative.</p>

<p>But if the events of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44-64 can thus be fixed with a fair
approximation to certainty, it is unfortunately otherwise with
the events of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29-44. Here we are dependent (i.) on general
indications given in the Acts; (ii.) on the evidence of the Epistle
to the Galatians, which, though in appearance more precise, can
be and is interpreted in very different ways.</p>

<p>(i.) The book of Acts is divided, by general summaries from
time to time inserted in the narrative, into six periods: i. 1-vi.
7, vi. 8-ix. 31, ix. 32-xii. 24, xii. 25-xvi. 5, xvi. 6-xix. 20,
xix. 2l-xxviii. 31. Of these the three last extend respectively
from the death of Herod to the start for Europe in the second missionary
journey (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44 to the spring of 50 [51]), from the start for
Europe to the end of the long stay at Ephesus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 50 [51] to the
spring of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 55 [56]), and from the departure from Ephesus
to the end of the two years&rsquo; captivity at Rome (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 55 [56] to
the beginning of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 61 [62]). It will be seen that these periods
are of more or less the same length, namely, six (or seven) years,
five years, six years. There is, therefore, some slight presumption
that the three earlier periods, which together cover about fifteen
years, were intended by so artistic a writer as St Luke to mark
each some similar lapse of time. If that were so, the preaching
of the apostles at Jerusalem and organization of the Church at the
capital&mdash;the preaching of the seven and the extension of the
Church all over Palestine&mdash;the extension of the Church to
Antioch, and the commencement of St Paul&rsquo;s work&mdash;might each
occupy five years more or less, that is to say, roughly, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29-34,
34-39, 39-44. The conversion of St Paul, which falls within
the second period, would on this arrangement fall somewhere
between five and ten years after the Crucifixion. Such conclusions
are, however, of course general in the extreme.</p>

<p>(ii.) A nearer attempt to date at least the chronology of St
Paul&rsquo;s earlier years as a Christian could be made by the help of
the Galatian Epistle if we could be sure from what point and to
what point its reckonings are made. The apostle tells us that on
his conversion he retired from Damascus into Arabia, and thence
returned to Damascus; then after three years (from his conversion)
he went up to Jerusalem, but stayed only a fortnight,
and went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. Then after fourteen
years (from his conversion? or from his last visit?) he went up to
Jerusalem again to confer with the elder apostles. Now, if
either of these visits to Jerusalem could be identified with any
of the visits whose dates have been approximately settled in the
chronology of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44-64, we should have a fixed point from
which to argue back. Unfortunately, even less agreement
exists on this head than on the question whether the fourteen
years of the last-mentioned visit are to be reckoned from the
conversion or from the previous visit. Most critics, indeed, are
now agreed that the fourteen years are to be calculated from the
conversion; and most of them still hold that the visit of
Galatians ii. is the same as the council of Acts xv., partly, no
doubt, on the ground that the latter visit was too important and
decisive for St Paul to have omitted in giving even the most
summary description of his relations with the twelve. This
ground would, however, be cut away from their feet if it were
possible to hold (with J.V. Bartlet, <i>Apostolic Age</i>, 1900, and
V. Weber, <i>Die Abfassung des Galaterbriefs vor dem Apostelkonzil</i>,
Ravensburg, 1900) that the epistle was actually written just
before the council, <i>i.e</i>. in the winter of 48-49 [49-50]. In that
case, of course, the two visits of Galatians i. and ii. would be
those of Acts ix. 26 and xi. 30. The fourteen years reckoned
back from the latter (<i>c</i>. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 46) would bring us to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 32-33 as
the latest possible date for the conversion. With the older view,
on the other hand, the fourteen years reckoned from the council
in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 49 [50] would allow us to bring down the conversion to
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 36. The new view clears away some manifest difficulties
in the reconciliation of the Epistle and the Acts, and the early
date for Galatians in relation to the other Pauline epistles is not
so improbable as it may seem; but the chronology still appears
more satisfactory on the older view, which enables the conversion
to be placed at least three years later than on the alternative
theory. But it is clear that the last word has not been said, and
that definite results for this period cannot yet be looked for.</p>

<p>To sum up: an attempt has been made, it is hoped with some
success, to provide a framework of history equipped with dates
from the time of St Peter&rsquo;s arrest by Herod Agrippa I. at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page894" id="page894"></a>894</span>
Passover of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44 down to the martyrdom of St Peter and St
Paul in the persecution of Nero, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 64-65. For the previous
period, on the other hand, from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 29 to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 44, it appeared
impossible in our present state of knowledge to state conclusions
other than in the most general form.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;The views stated in this article are in general
(though with some modifications) the same as those which the
present writer worked out with more fulness of detail in Hastings&rsquo;
<i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, i. (1898) 403-424. Of older books should
be mentioned:&mdash;Ideler, <i>Handbuch der mathematischen
und technischen Chronologie</i> (2 vols., 1825);
Wieseler, <i>Chronologie des apostolischen Zeitalters</i> (1848);
Lewin&rsquo;s <i>Fasti Sacri</i> (1865).
Important modern contributions are to be found in Prof. (Sir) W.M.
Ramsay&rsquo;s various works, and in Harnack&rsquo;s <i>Chronologie der altchristlichen
Litteratur bis Eusebius</i>, i. 233-244. Mention should also be
made of an article, containing much useful astronomical and
Talmudical information, by Mr J.K. Fotheringham, &ldquo;The Date of the
Crucifixion,&rdquo; in the <i>Journal of Philology</i>, xxix. 100-118 (1904).
Mr Fotheringham is of opinion that the evidence from Christian
sources is too uncertain, and that the statements of the Mishnah
must be the starting-point of the inquiry: taking then the phasis
of the new moon as the true beginning of Nisan, he concludes that
Friday cannot have coincided with Nisan 14 in any year, within the
period <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 28-35, other than <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 33 (April 3rd). But in one of the
two empirical tests of the value of these calculations that he was
able to obtain (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 106, n. 2), the new moon was seen a day
earlier than his rules allowed. This being so, it would be premature
to disregard the convergent lines of historical evidence which tell
against <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 33. Among the latest German works may be cited
the chapter on New Testament chronology in the <i>Neutestamentliche
Zeitgeschichte</i> of Dr Oscar Holtzmann (2nd ed., 1906), pp. 117-147:
regarded as a collection of historical material this deserves every
praise, but the mass is undigested and the treatment of the evidence
arbitrary. As might be expected, Dr Holtzmann&rsquo;s conclusions are
clear-cut, and alternatives are rigidly excluded: the Crucifixion is
dated on the 7th of April <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 30, and St Paul&rsquo;s arrest (with the older
writers) at Pentecost <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 58.</p>

building of the temple at the later date, but probably he errs in
connecting it with the secession of Manasseh, which, according
to Nehemiah, occurred a century earlier; it has been suggested
that he has confused Darius Codomannus with his predecessor,
Darius Nothus.</p>

<i>priority</i> to Aquila on the grounds, (1) that Irenaeus mentions
him before Aquila, and (2) that, after Aquila&rsquo;s version had been adopted
by the Greek Jews, a work such as that of Theodotion would have been
somewhat superfluous. Theodotion&rsquo;s work, he suggests, formed
the first stage towards the establishment of a Greek version which
should correspond more closely with the Hebrew. Moreover, this
theory affords the simplest explanation of its disappearance from
Jewish tradition.</p>

authorities, however, assign considerably lower dates for the
dynasties prior to the 18th. Thus Breasted (<i>Hist. of Egypt</i>,
1906, pp. 22 ff., 221, 597) agrees with Ed. Meyer in giving, for
reasons which cannot be here explained, for the beginning of the 1st
dynasty <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">B.C.</span> 3400, for the 4th dynasty <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">B.C.</span> 2900-2750, and for

others. The date rests upon a statement of Nabu-na&rsquo;id&rsquo;s, that Sargon&rsquo;s
son, Naram-Sin, reigned 3200 years before himself. Lehmann holds that
there are reasons for believing that the engraver, by error, put a
stroke too many, and that 2200 should be read instead of 3200.</p>

<p><a name="ft42a" id="ft42a" href="#fa42a"><span class="fn">42</span></a> The lists of the Babylonian and Assyrian kings are not continuous;
and before 1907, from the data then available (see the discussion in
Rogers, op. cit. i. 312-348), Khammurabi, the sixth king of the
first Babylonian dynasty, was commonly referred to such dates as
2376-2333 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Sayce) or 2285-2242 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Johns). But inscriptions
recently discovered, by showing that the second dynasty was partly
contemporaneous with the first and the third, have proved that these
dates are too high; see L.W. King, <i>Chronicles Concerning Early
Bab. Kings</i> (1907), i. 93-110; and the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Babylonia</a></span>,
<i>Chronology</i>. The data <span class="scs">B.C.</span> 2130-2088 is that adopted by
Thureau-Dangin, after a discussion of the subject, in the <i>Journal
des Savants</i>, 1908, p. 199; and by Ungnad in the <i>Orient.
Litt.-zeitung</i>, 1908, p. 13, and in Gressmann&rsquo;s <i>Altorientalische

<p><a name="ft43a" id="ft43a" href="#fa43a"><span class="fn">43</span></a> King, op. cit. i. 116, ii. 14.</p>

<p><a name="ft44a" id="ft44a" href="#fa44a"><span class="fn">44</span></a> The dates of the kings are, in most cases, those given by Kautzsch in
the table in his <i>Outline of the Hist. of the Literature of the O.T.</i>
(tr. by Taylor, 1898), pp. 167 ff.; see also A.R.S. Kennedy, &ldquo;Samuel&rdquo;
in the <i>Century Bible</i> (1906), p. 31. The dates given by other
recent authorities seldom differ by more than three or four years.</p>

<p><a name="ft45a" id="ft45a" href="#fa45a"><span class="fn">45</span></a> The figures after a king&rsquo;s name indicate the number of years assigned
to his reign in the O.T. For Saul, see 1 Sam. xiii. 1, R.V.</p>

<p><a name="ft46a" id="ft46a" href="#fa46a"><span class="fn">46</span></a> The date of Sheshonq depends on that fixed for Rehoboam. Petrie places
the accession of Rehoboam in 937 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p><a name="ft47a" id="ft47a" href="#fa47a"><span class="fn">47</span></a> If these dates are correct, there must be some error in the ages
assigned to Ahaz and Hezekiah at their accession, viz. 20 and 25
respectively, for it would otherwise follow from them that Ahaz, dying
at the age of [20 + 8 =] 28, left a son aged 25! The date 728 for
Hezekiah&rsquo;s accession rests upon the assumption that of the two
inconsistent dates in 2 Kings xviii. 10, 13, the one in ver. 10
(which places the fall of Samaria in Hezekiah&rsquo;s 6th year) is correct;
but some scholars (as Wellhausen, Kamphausen, and Stade) suppose that the
date in ver. 10 (which places Sennacherib&rsquo;s invasion in Hezekiah&rsquo;s
14th year) is correct, and assign accordingly Hezekiah&rsquo;s accession to
715. This removes, or at least mitigates, the difficulty referred to,
and leaves more room for the reigns of Jotham and Ahaz; but it
requires, of course, a corresponding reduction in the reigns of the
kings succeeding Ahaz.</p>

<p><a name="ft48a" id="ft48a" href="#fa48a"><span class="fn">48</span></a> Breasted&rsquo;s dates for these three kings (<i>Hist. of Egypt</i>, 1906,
p. 601) are: Shabaka 712-700; Shabataka 700-688; Taharqa 688-663.</p>

<p><a name="ft49a" id="ft49a" href="#fa49a"><span class="fn">49</span></a> See George Smith, <i>The Assyrian Eponym Canon</i> (1875),
pp. 29 ff., 57 ff.; Schrader, <i>Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</i>

i. (1889), pp. 204 ff.</p>

<p><a name="ft50a" id="ft50a" href="#fa50a"><span class="fn">50</span></a> It may be explained here that the dates of the Assyrian and Babylonian
kings can be reduced to years <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by means of the so-called &ldquo;Canon of
Ptolemy,&rdquo; which is a list of the Babylonian and
Persian kings, with the lengths of their reigns, extending from
Nabonassar, 747 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, to Alexander the Great, drawn up in the
2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> by the celebrated Egyptian mathematician and
geographer Ptolemy; as the dates <span class="scs">B.C.</span> of the Persian kings are known
independently, from Greek sources, the dates <span class="scs">B.C.</span> of the preceding
Babylonian kings can, of course, be at once calculated by means of
the Canon. The recently-discovered contemporary monuments have
fully established the accuracy of the Canon.</p>

<p><a name="ft51a" id="ft51a" href="#fa51a"><span class="fn">51</span></a> Or, in any case, between 734 and 732; see Rost,
<i>Die Keilschrifttexte Tiglat-pilesers III.</i>, 1893,
pp. xii., 39, 81, with the discussion, pp. xxxii.-xxxiv., xxxv.-xxxvi.</p>

<p><a name="ft52a" id="ft52a" href="#fa52a"><span class="fn">52</span></a> This interval does not depend upon a mere list of Eponym years;
we have in the annals of Sargon and Sennacherib full particulars
of the events in all the intervening years.</p>

<p><a name="ft53a" id="ft53a" href="#fa53a"><span class="fn">53</span></a> The date of this epistle is rather uncertain. Something depends
upon the vexed question as to the identity of the Galatian churches.
The epistle may be placed conjecturally early in the stay at Ephesus
(<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 52-53). It is to be noted that the chronological grouping
of the epistles by minute comparison of style is apt to be deceptive;
resemblances of this kind are due more to similarity of subject than
to proximity in date.</p>

<p><a name="ft54a" id="ft54a" href="#fa54a"><span class="fn">54</span></a> <i>E.g.</i> from the preface to the Acts: &ldquo;Dionysius, bishop of the
Corinthians, a very ancient writer, quoted by Eusebius, writes
that Peter and Paul obtained the crown of martyrdom by the command
of Nero on the same day.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;Some industrious
critics have added (to the narrative of Acts) that Paul was acquitted
at his first trial by Nero .... This conjecture they make from the
2nd Ep. to Timothy....&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="ft55a" id="ft55a" href="#fa55a"><span class="fn">55</span></a> The phrase is Chillingworth&rsquo;s (1637), who may be described as
a Broad High-churchman.</p>

<p><a name="ft56a" id="ft56a" href="#fa56a"><span class="fn">56</span></a>  J. Wellhausen, <i>Einl. in die drei ersten Evangelien</i> (1905), p. 57.</p>

<p><a name="ft57a" id="ft57a" href="#fa57a"><span class="fn">57</span></a> If Luke used Josephus, as F.C. Burkitt and others believe, the
later date must be taken; otherwise the earlier date is more probable,
as in any case it must fall within the lifetime of a companion
of St Paul.</p>

<p><a name="ft58a" id="ft58a" href="#fa58a"><span class="fn">58</span></a>  It is a curious coincidence that a medieval Jew, R. Abarbanel
(Abrabanel), records that the conjunction of these particular planets
in this particular constellation was to be a sign of Messiah&rsquo;s coming.
It is just conceivable that his statement may ultimately depend
on some such ancient tradition as may have been known to Chaldaean
magi.</p>

<p><a name="ft59a" id="ft59a" href="#fa59a"><span class="fn">59</span></a> If the Passover celebration could be anticipated by one day in
a private Jewish family (and we know perhaps too little of Jewish
rules in the time of Christ to be able to exclude this possibility), the
evidence of the synoptic Gospels would no longer conflict with
that of St John.</p>

<p><a name="ft60a" id="ft60a" href="#fa60a"><span class="fn">60</span></a> Dr C. Erbes (<i>Texte and Untersuchungen</i>, new series, iv. 1) attempts
to interpret the evidence of Eusebius in favour of the later date for
Festus as follows: Eusebius&rsquo;s date for Festus is to be found in Nero
1, by striking a mean between the Armenian, Claudius 12, and the
Latin, Nero 2; it is really to be understood as reckoned, not by
years of Nero, but by years of Agrippa; and as Eusebius erroneously
antedated Agrippa&rsquo;s reign by five years, commencing it with <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 45
instead of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 50, his date for Festus is five years too early also, and
should be moved to Nero 6, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 59-60. The whole of this theory
appears to the present writer to be a gigantic mare&rsquo;s nest: see
<i>Journal of Theological Studies</i> (October 1901), pp. 120-123.</p>

<p><a name="ft61a" id="ft61a" href="#fa61a"><span class="fn">61</span></a> This date appears to be satisfactorily established by Ramsay,
&ldquo;A Second Fixed Point in the Pauline Chronology,&rdquo; <i>Expositor</i>, August 1900.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIBLE, ENGLISH<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span>. The history of the vernacular Bible of
the English race resolves itself into two distinctly marked
periods&mdash;the one being that of Manuscript Bibles, which were
direct translations from the Latin Vulgate, the other that of
Printed Bibles, which were, more or less completely, translations
from the original Hebrew and Greek of the Old and New
Testaments.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Manuscript Bible.</i>&mdash;The first essays in Biblical
translation, or rather paraphrasing, assumed in English, as in many
other languages, a poetical form. Even in the 7th
century, according to the testimony of Bede (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>
<span class="sidenote">Cædmon.</span>
iv. 24), Cædmon sang &ldquo;de creatione mundi et origine
humani generis, et tota Genesis historia, de egressu Israel ex
Aegypto et ingressu in terram repromissionis, de aliis plurimis
sacrae Scripturae historiis, de incarnatione Dominica, passione,
resurrectione et ascensione in coelum, de Spiritus Sancti adventu,
et apostolorum doctrina.&rdquo; It is, however, doubtful whether
any of the poetry which has been ascribed to him can claim to
be regarded as his genuine work.</p>

<p>The first prose rendering of any part of the Bible&mdash;and
with these we are mainly concerned in the present
inquiry&mdash;originated in all probability in the 8th century,
when Bede, the eminent scholar and churchman, translated
<span class="sidenote">Bede.</span>
the first portion (chs. i.-vi. 9) of the Gospel of St John into the
vernacular, but no part of this rendering is extant. His pupil
Cuthberht recorded this fact in a letter to a fellow-student,
Cuthwine: &ldquo;a capite sancti evangelii Johannis usque ad eum
locum in quo dicitur, &lsquo;sed haec quid sunt inter tantos?&rsquo; in
nostram linguam ad utilitatem ecclesiae Dei convertit&rdquo; (Mayor
and Lumby, <i>Bedae Hist. Eccl.</i> p. 178).</p>

<p>The 9th century is characterized by <i>interlinear glosses on the
Book of Psalms</i>, and towards its close by a few attempts at
independent translation. Of these &ldquo;glossed Psalters&rdquo;
twelve MSS. are known to exist, and they may be
<span class="sidenote">9th and 10th century glosses.</span>
ranged into two groups according to the Latin text
they represent. The <i>Roman Psalter</i> is glossed in the
following MSS.: (1) Cotton Vesp. A. 1 (<i>Vespasian Psalter</i>);
(2) Bodl. Junius 27; (3) Univ. Libr. Camb. Ff. 1. 23; (4) Brit.
Mus. Reg. 2. B. 5; (5) Trin. Coll. Camb. R. 17. 1 (<i>Eadwine&rsquo;s
Psalter</i>); (6) Brit. Mus. Add. 37517. The <i>Gallican Psalter</i> in the
following: (1) Brit. Mus. Stowe 2 (Spelman&rsquo;s text); (2) Cotton
Vitell. E. 18; (3) Cotton Tib. C. 16; (4) Lambeth 48; (5)
Arundel 60; (6) Salisbury Cath. 150.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The oldest and most important of these MSS. is the so-called
<i>Vespasian Psalter</i>, which was written in Mercia in the first half
of the 9th century. It was in all probability the original from
which all the above-mentioned Old English glosses were derived,
though in several instances changes and modifications were
introduced by successive scribes. The first verse of Psalm <i>c.</i>
(Vulg. xcix. 2) may serve as a specimen of these glosses.</p>

<p>To the late 9th or early 10th century a work may be assigned
which is in so far an advance upon preceding efforts as to be a
real translation, not a mere gloss corresponding word for word
with the Latin original. This is the famous <i>Paris Psalter</i>,<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
a rendering of the first fifty Psalms (Vulg. i.-l. 10), contained in
the unique MS. <i>lat. 8824</i> in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.
The authorship of this version is doubtful, being by some scholars
attributed to King Alfred (d. 901), of whom William of Malmesbury
writes (<i>Gesta Regum Anglorum</i>, ii. 123), &ldquo;Psalterium
transferre aggressus vix prima parte explicata vivendi finem
fecit.&rdquo; This view is, however, denied by others.</p>

<p>In the course of the 10th century the Gospels were glossed
and translated. The earliest in date is a <i>Northumbrian Gloss
on the Gospels</i>, contained in a beautiful and highly
interesting MS. variously known as the <i>Durham
Book</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Lindisfarne Gospels.</span>
the <i>Lindisfarne Gospels</i>, or the <i>Book of
St Cuthbert</i> (MS. Cotton, Nero. D. 4). The Latin text
dates from the close of the 7th century, and is the work of
Eadfrith, bishop of Lindisfarne (698-721). The English gloss was
added about a century and a half later (<i>c.</i> 950) by one Aldred,
whom Dr Charles O&rsquo;Conor (<i>Bibl. Stowensis</i>, 1818-1819, ii. 180)
supposes to have been the bishop of Durham of that name.
The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer is glossed in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pt2">Of a somewhat later date is the celebrated <i>Rushworth Version
of the Gospels</i> (MS. Bodl. Auct. D. ii. 9), which contains an
independent translation of the Gospel of St Matthew,
and a gloss on those of St Mark, St Luke and St John,
<span class="sidenote">Rushworth Version.</span>
founded upon the Lindisfarne glosses. From a note
in the manuscript we learn that two men, Færman and Owun,
made the version. Færman was a priest at Harewood, or
Harwood, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and to him
the best part of the work is due. He translated the whole of
St Matthew, and wrote the gloss of St Mark i.-ii. 15, and
St John xviii. 1-3. The remaining part, a mere transcript, is
Owun&rsquo;s work. The dialect of the translation of St Matthew is
Mercian.<a name="fa4b" id="fa4b" href="#ft4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>A further testimony to the activity which prevailed in the
field of Biblical lore is the fact that at the close of the century&mdash;probably
about the year 1000&mdash;the Gospels were
rendered anew for the first time in the south of England.
<span class="sidenote">West-Saxon Gospels.</span>
Of this version&mdash;the so-called <i>West-Saxon
Gospels</i>&mdash;not less than seven manuscripts have come
down to us. A note in one of these, MS. Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, 140, states, <i>ego Ælfricus scripsi hunc librum in
Monasterio Baðþonio et dedi Brihtwoldo preposito</i>, but of this
Ælfric and his superior nothing further is known.<a name="fa5b" id="fa5b" href="#ft5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer is rendered in the following way in these
gospels:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">

</div>

<p>Towards the close of the century the Old Testament found
a translator in Ælfric (<i>q.v.</i>), the most eminent scholar in the close
of the 10th and the opening decades of the 11th century.
According to his own statement in <i>De vetere testamento</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Ælfric.</span>
written about 1010, he had at that period translated the Pentateuch,
Joshua, Judges, Kings, Job, Esther, Judith and the
Maccabees.<a name="fa6b" id="fa6b" href="#ft6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a> His rendering is clear and idiomatic, and though
he frequently abridges, the omissions never obscure the meaning
or hinder the easy flow of the narrative.</p>

<p>Dietrich, Ælfric&rsquo;s most competent biographer (Niedner&rsquo;s,
<i>Zeitschrift für historische Theologie</i>, 1855-1856), looks upon the
Pentateuch, Joshua and Judges as a continuation of his <i>Lives
of Saints</i>, including as they do in a series of narratives the Old
Testament saints. Genesis is but slightly abridged, but Job,
Kings, Judges, Esther and Judith as well as the Maccabees are
mere homilies epitomized from the corresponding Old Testament
books. Judith is metrical in form.</p>

<p>The 11th century, with its political convulsions, resulting
in the establishment of an alien rule and the partial suppression
of the language of the conquered race, was unfavourable to
literary efforts of any kind in the vernacular. With the exception
of Ælfric&rsquo;s late works at the very dawn of the century, we
can only record two transcripts of the West-Saxon Gospels as
coming at all within the scope of our inquiry.</p>

<p>In the 12th century the same gospels were again copied by
pious hands into the Kentish dialect of the period.</p>

<p>The 13th century, from the point of view of Biblical renderings
into the vernacular, is an absolute blank. French&mdash;or rather
the Anglo-Norman dialect of the period&mdash;reigned
supreme amongst the upper classes, in schools, in
<span class="sidenote">Anglo-Norman Period.</span>
parliament, in the courts of law and in the palace of
the king. English lurked in farms and hovels, amongst
villeins and serfs, in the outlying country-districts, in the distant
monasteries, amongst the lower clergy, amongst the humble and
lowly and ignorant. There were certainly renderings of the
Bible during the 12th, 13th and early 14th centuries, but they
were all in French. Some of these translations were made in
England, some were brought over to England and copied and
recopied. Amongst the latter was the magnificently illuminated
Norman Commentary on the Apocalypse, some of the
earliest copies of which were written in an English hand. In
fact before the middle of the 14th century the entire Old Testament
and the greater part of the New Testament had been
translated into the Anglo-Norman dialect of the period. (MSS.
Bibl. Nat. fr. 1, 9562, Brit. Mus. Reg. I.C. iii. Cf. S. Berger,
<i>La Bible française au moyen âge</i>, Paris, 1884, pp. 78 ff.)</p>

<p>When English finally emerged victorious, towards the middle
and latter half of the 14th century, it was for all practical purposes
a new language, largely intermixed with French, differing
from the language of the older period in sound, flexion and
structure. It is evident that any Old English versions which
might have survived the ravages of time would now be unintelligible,
it was equally natural that as soon as French came to
be looked upon as an alien tongue, the French versions hitherto
in use would fail to fulfil their purpose, and that attempts should
again be made to render the Bible into the only language
<span class="sidenote">14th-century renderings.</span>
intelligible to the greater part of the nation&mdash;into
English. It was also natural that these attempts
should be made where the need was most pressing,
where French had gained least footing, where parliament
and court were remote, where intercourse with France was
difficult. In fact in the Northern Midlands, and in the North
even before the middle of the 14th century, the book of Psalms
had been twice rendered into English, and before the end of
the same century, probably before the great Wycliffite versions
had spread over the country, the whole of the New Testament
had been translated by different hands into one or other of the
dialects of this part of the country.</p>

<p>At the same time we can record only a single rendering during
the whole century which originated in the south of England,
namely the text of James, Peter, 1 John and the Pauline Epistles
(edited by A.C. Paues, Cambridge, 1904).</p>

<p>Of these pre-Wycliffite versions possibly the earliest is the
<i>West Midland Psalter</i>, once erroneously ascribed to William of
Shoreham.<a name="fa7b" id="fa7b" href="#ft7b"><span class="sp">7</span></a> It occurs in three MSS., the earliest of which,
Brit. Mus. Add. 17376, was probably written between 1340 and
1350. It contains a complete version of the book of Psalms,
followed by the usual eleven canticles and the Athanasian Creed.
The Latin original is a glossed version of the Vulgate, and in the
English translation the words of the gloss are often substituted
for the strong and picturesque expressions of the Biblical text;
in other respects the rendering is faithful and idiomatic. The
following two verses of the first psalm may exemplify this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="center"><i>MS. British Mus. Add. 17376.</i></p>

<p>(i. 1.) <i>Beatus uir, qui non abijt in consilio impiorum, &amp; in uia
peccatorum non stetit, et in cathedra ·i· iudicio pestilencie ·i· falsitatis
non sedit.</i> Blesced be þe man þat &#541;ede nou&#541;t in þe counseil of wicked,
ne stode nou&#541;t in þe waie of sinyeres, ne sat nouyt in fals iugement.
(2) <i>Set in lege domini uoluntas eius, &amp; in lege eius meditabitur die ac
nocte.</i> Ac hijs wylle was in þe wylle of oure Lord, and he schal
þenche in hijs lawe boþe daye and ny&#541;t.</p>
</div>

<p>Before the middle of the century Richard Rolle (<i>q.v.</i>), the
hermit of Hampole (+ 1349), turned into English, with certain
additions and omissions, the famous <i>Commentary on
the Psalms</i> by Peter Lombard. The work was undertaken,
<span class="sidenote">Richard Rolle.</span>
as the metrical prologue of one of the copies tells
us (MS. Laud. misc. 286), &ldquo;At a worthy recluse prayer, cald
dame Merget Kyrkby.&rdquo; The Commentary gained immediate
and lasting popularity, and spread in numerous copies throughout
the country, the peculiarities of the hermit&rsquo;s vigorous northern
dialect being either modified or wholly removed in the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page896" id="page896"></a>896</span>
southerly transcripts. The translation, however, is stiff and
literal to a fault, violating idiomatic usage and the proper
order of words in its strict adherence to the Latin. The following
brief extracts may exemplify the hermit&rsquo;s rendering and the
change the text underwent in later copies.<a name="fa8b" id="fa8b" href="#ft8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

</table></div>

<p>Approximately to the same period as these early renderings
of the Psalter belongs a version of the <i>Apocalypse with a
Commentary</i>, the earliest MS. of which (Harleian 874) is written
in the dialect of the North Midlands. This Commentary, for a long
time attributed to Wycliffe, is really nothing but a verbal
rendering of the popular and widely-spread Norman Commentary
on the Apocalypse (Paul Meyer and L. Delisle, <i>L&rsquo;Apocalypse en
Français au XIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i>, Paris, 1901), which dates back as far
as the first half of the 13th century, and in its general tenor
represents the height of orthodoxy. The English apocalypse, to
judge from the number of MSS. remaining, must have enjoyed
great and lasting popularity. Several revisions of the text exist,
the later of which present such striking agreement with the later
Wycliffite version that we shall not be far wrong if we assume
that they were made use of to a considerable extent by the
revisers of this version.</p>

<p>To the North Midlands or the North belongs further a complete
version of the <i>Pauline Epistles</i> found in the unique MS. 32,
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, of the 15th century.</p>

<p><i>Commentaries on the Gospels of St Matthew, St Mark and St
Luke</i>, we are told by the heading in one of the MSS. (Univ. Libr.
Camb. Ii. 2. 12), were also translated into English by &ldquo;a man of
þe north cuntre.&rdquo; The translation of these Gospels as well as of
the Epistles referred to above is stiff and awkward, the translator
being evidently afraid of any departure from the Latin text of
his original. The accompanying commentary is based on the
Fathers of the Church and entirely devoid of any original matter.
The opening lines of the third chapter of Matthew are rendered
in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="center"><i>MS. Camb. Univ. Libr. Ii. 2. 12.</i></p>

<p>(iii. 1.) In þo dayes come Ihone baptist prechand in desert of þe

&amp; his mete was þe locust &amp; hony of þe wode.</p>
</div>

<p>A version of the <i>Acts and the Catholic Epistles</i> completes the
number of the New Testament books translated in the northern
parts of England. It is found in several MSS. either separately
or in conjunction with a fragmentary <i>Southern Version of the
Pauline Epistles, Peter, James and 1 John</i> in a curiously compiled
volume, evidently made, as the prologue tells us, by a brother
superior for the use and edification of an ignorant &ldquo;sister,&rdquo; or
woman vowed to religion.<a name="fa9b" id="fa9b" href="#ft9b"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The translation of this, our only
southern text, surpasses all previous efforts from the point of
view of clearness of expression and idiomatic use of English, and,
though less exact, it may be even said in these respects to rank
equal with the later or revised Wycliffite version.</p>

<p>Apart from these more or less complete versions of separate
books of the Bible, there existed also numerous renderings of the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, accounts of the Life,
Passion and Resurrection of our Lord, translations of the
epistles and gospels used in divine service, and other means of
familiarizing the people with Holy Scripture. It was the custom
of the medieval preachers and writers to give their own English
version of any text which they quoted, not resorting as in later
times to a commonly received translation. This explains the
fact that in collections of medieval homilies that have come down
to us, no two renderings of the Biblical text used are ever alike,
not even Wyclilfe himself making use of the text of the commonly
accepted versions that went under his name.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that these early versions from Anglo-Saxon
times onwards were perfectly orthodox, executed by and for good
and faithful sons of the church, and, generally speaking, with
the object of assisting those whose knowledge of Latin proved too
scanty for a proper interpretation and understanding of the holy
text. Thus Richard Rolle&rsquo;s version of the Psalms was executed
for a nun; so was in all likelihood the southern version of the
epistles referred to above. Again the earliest MS. (Harl. 874)
of the Commentary on the Apocalypse gives the owner&rsquo;s name in a
coeval hand as &ldquo;Richard Schepard, <i>presbiter</i>,&rdquo; and the Catholic
Epistles of MS. Douce 250<a name="fa10b" id="fa10b" href="#ft10b"><span class="sp">10</span></a> were probably glossed for the
benefit of men in religious orders, if one may judge from a short
Commentary to James ii. 2, &ldquo;&amp; þerfore if eny man come into
youre si&#541;t, <i>þat is, into youre cumpenye þat beþ Godes religiouse
men in what degre so &#541;e be</i>.&rdquo; Nor do any of the remaining works
contain anything but what is strictly orthodox.</p>

<p>It is first with the appearance of Wycliffe (<i>q.v.</i>) and his followers
on the arena of religious controversy that the Bible in English
came to be looked upon with suspicion by the orthodox
party within the Church. For it is a well-known fact
<span class="sidenote">The Wycliffite Versions.</span>
that Wycliffe proclaimed the Bible, not the Church
or Catholic tradition, as a man&rsquo;s supreme spiritual
authority, and that he sought in consequence by every means in
his power to spread the knowledge of it among the people. It
is, therefore, in all likelihood to the zeal of Wycliffe and his
followers that we owe the two noble 14th-century translations of
the Bible which tradition has always associated with his name,
and which are the earliest complete renderings that we possess of
the Holy Scriptures into English.<a name="fa11b" id="fa11b" href="#ft11b"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p>The first of these, the so-called <i>Early Version</i>, was probably
completed about 1382, at all events before 1384, the year of
Wycliffe&rsquo;s death. The second, or <i>Later Version</i>, being a thorough
revision of the first, is ascribed to the year 1388 by Sir Frederic
Madden and the Rev. Joshua Forshall in their edition of these
two versions.<a name="fa12b" id="fa12b" href="#ft12b"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>It is a matter of uncertainty what part, if any, Wycliffe himself
took in the work. The editors of the Wycliffite versions say in
the Preface, pp. xv. ff.&mdash;&ldquo;The New Testament was naturally the
first object. The text of the Gospels was extracted from the
Commentary upon them by Wycliffe, and to these were added the
Epistles, the Acts and the Apocalypse, all now translated anew.
This translation might probably be the work of Wycliffe himself;
at least the similarity of style between the Gospels and the other
parts favours the supposition.&rdquo; The Wycliffite authorship of
the Commentaries on the Gospels, on which the learned editors
base their argument, is, however, unsupported by any evidence
beyond the fact that the writer of the Prologue to Matthew
urges in strong language &ldquo;the propriety of translating Scripture
for the use of the laity.&rdquo; The Biblical text found in these
Commentaries is in fact so far removed from the original type
of the Early Version as to be transitional to the Late, and, what
is still more convincing, passages from the Early Version, from
both the Old Testament and the New Testament, are actually
quoted in the Commentary. Under such circumstances it
would be folly to look upon them as anything but late productions,
at all events later than the Early Version, and equal folly to
assign these bulky volumes to the last two years of Wycliffe&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page897" id="page897"></a>897</span>
life merely because the text used in them happens to be that of
the Early Version. It is therefore at present impossible to say
what part of the Early Version of the New Testament was
translated by Wycliffe.<a name="fa13b" id="fa13b" href="#ft13b"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p>The Old Testament of the Early Version was, according to the
editors (Preface, p. xvii.), taken in hand by one of Wycliffe&rsquo;s
coadjutors, Nicholas de Herford. The translator&rsquo;s original copy
and a coeval transcript of it are still extant in the Bodleian
library (Bodl. 959, Douce 360). Both break off abruptly at
Baruch iii. 19, the latter having at this place a note inserted
to the following effect: <i>Explicit translacionem Nicholay de
herford</i>. There is consequently but little doubt that Nicholas
de Herford took part in the translation of the Old Testament,
though it is uncertain to what extent. The translator&rsquo;s copy is
written in not less than five hands, differing in orthography and
dialect. The note may therefore be taken to refer either to the
portion translated by the last or fifth hand, or to the whole of the
Old Testament up to Baruch iii. 19. Judging from uniformity
of style and mode of translation the editors of the Bible are
inclined to take the latter view; they add that the remaining
part of the Old Testament was completed by a different hand,
the one which also translated the New Testament. This statement
is, however, not supported by sufficient evidence. In view
of the magnitude of the undertaking it is on the contrary highly
probable that other translators besides Wycliffe and Nicholas de
Herford took part in the work, and that already existing versions,
with changes when necessary, were incorporated or made use of
by the translators.</p>

<p>The Early Version, apart from its completeness, shows but
little advance upon preceding efforts. It is true that the translation
is more careful and correct than some of the renderings
noticed above, but on the other hand it shares all their faults.
The translation of the Old Testament as far as Baruch iii. 19 is
stiff and awkward, sometimes unintelligible, even nonsensical,
from a too close adherence to the Latin text (<i>e.g.</i> Judges xx. 25).
In the remaining parts the translation is somewhat easier and
more skilful, though even here Latinisms and un-English renderings
abound.</p>

<p>It is small wonder, therefore, if a revision was soon found
necessary and actually taken in hand within a few years of the
completion of the Earlier Version. The principles of work
adopted by the revisers are laid down in the general prologue to
their edition, the so-called &ldquo;Later Version.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">

the bible out of Latyn into English. First, this symple creature

and to haue manie gode felawis and kuonynge at the correcting of

</div>

<p>It is uncertain who the revisers were; John Purvey, the
leader of the Lollard party after Wycliffe&rsquo;s death, is generally
assumed to have taken a prominent part in the work, but the
evidence of this is extremely slight (cf. Wycl. Bible, Preface,
oo. xxv. f.). The exact date of the revision is also doubtful: the
editors of the Wycliffe Bible, judging from the internal evidence
of the Prologue, assume it to have been finished about 1388.
This Revised or Later Version is in every way a readable,
correct rendering of the Scriptures, it is far more idiomatic than
the Earlier, having been freed from the greater number of its
Latinisms; its vocabulary is less archaic. Its popularity admits
of no doubt, for even now in spite of neglect and persecution, in
spite of the ravages of fire and time, over 150 copies remain to
testify to this fact. The following specimens of the Early
and Late Versions will afford a comparison with preceding
renderings:&mdash;</p>

<p>The 15th century may well be described as the <i>via dolorosa</i>
of the English Bible as well as of its chief advocates and supporters,
the Lollards. After the death of Wycliffe
violence and anarchy set in, and the Lollards came
<span class="sidenote">The Lollards.</span>
gradually to be looked upon as enemies of order and
disturbers of society. Stern measures of suppression were
directed not only against them but against &ldquo;Goddis Lawe,&rdquo; the
book for which they pleaded with such passionate earnestness.
The bishops&rsquo; registers bear sufficient testimony to this fact.<a name="fa14b" id="fa14b" href="#ft14b"><span class="sp">14</span></a>
It would appear, however, as if at first at all events the persecution
was directed not so much against the Biblical text itself as
against the Lollard interpretations which accompanied it. In a
convocation held at Oxford under Archbishop Arundel in 1408
it was enacted &ldquo;that no man hereafter by his own authority
translate any text of the Scripture into English or any other
tongue, by way of a book, booklet, or tract; and that no man
read any such book, booklet, or tract, now lately composed in
the time of John Wycliffe or since, or hereafter to be set forth in
part or in whole, publicly or privately, upon pain of greater
excommunication, until the said translation be approved by the
ordinary of the place, or, if the case so require, by the council
provincial. He that shall do contrary to this shall likewise be
punished as a favourer of heresy and error.&rdquo;<a name="fa15b" id="fa15b" href="#ft15b"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>

<p>It must be allowed that an enactment of this kind was not
without justification. The Lollards, for instance, did not
hesitate to introduce into certain copies of the pious and orthodox
Commentary on the Psalms by the hermit of Hampole interpolations
of their own of the most virulently controversial kind
(MSS. Trin. Coll. Camb. B.V. 25, Brit. Mus. Reg. 18. C. 26, &amp;c.),
and although the text of their Biblical versions was faithful and
true, the General Prologue of the Later Version was interlarded
with controversial matter. It is small wonder if the prelates and
priests sought to repress such trenchant criticism of their lives
and doctrines as appeared more especially in the former work,
and probably in many others which since have perished in
&ldquo;faggots and burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For all this, manuscripts of Purvey&rsquo;s Revision were copied
and re-copied during this century, the text itself being evidently
approved by the ecclesiastical authorities, when in the hands of
the right people and if unaccompanied by controversial matter.</p>

<p>Of the Lollard movement in Scotland but little is known, but
a curious relic has come down to our times in the shape of a New
Testament of Purvey&rsquo;s Revision in the Scottish dialect of the
early 16th century. The transcriber was in all probability a
certain Murdoch Nisbet, who also showed his reforming tendencies
by adding to it a rendering of Luther&rsquo;s Prologue to the
New Testament.<a name="fa16b" id="fa16b" href="#ft16b"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page898" id="page898"></a>898</span></p>

<p><i>2. The Printed Bible.</i>&mdash;It is singular that while France,
Spain, Italy, Bohemia and Holland possessed the Bible in the
vernacular before the accession of Henry VIII., and in Germany
the Scriptures were printed in 1466 and seventeen times reprinted
before Luther began his great work, yet no English
printer attempted to put the familiar English Bible into type.
No part of the English Bible was printed before 1525, no complete
Bible before 1535, and none in England before 1538.</p>

<p>Versions of the Scriptures so far noticed were all secondary
renderings of the Vulgate, translations of a translation. It was
only with the advent of the &ldquo;new learning&rdquo; in England that
a direct rendering from the originals became possible. Erasmus
in 1516 published the New Testament in Greek, with a new
Latin version of his own; the Hebrew text of the Old Testament
had been published as early as 1488.</p>

<p>The first to take advantage of these altered conditions was
William Tyndale (<i>q.v.</i>), &ldquo;to whom,&rdquo; as Dr Westcott says,<a name="fa17b" id="fa17b" href="#ft17b"><span class="sp">17</span></a> &ldquo;it
has been allowed more than to any other man to give
its characteristic shape to the English Bible.&rdquo; Of
<span class="sidenote">William Tyndale.</span>
Tyndale&rsquo;s early life but little is known. Be it enough
for our purpose to say that he thoroughly saturated his mind
with the &ldquo;new learning,&rdquo; first at Oxford, where in 1515 he was
admitted to the degree of M.A., and then in Cambridge, where
the fame of Erasmus still lingered. Before the beginning of
1522 we find Tyndale as chaplain and tutor in the family of
Sir John Walsh of Old Sodbury in Gloucestershire. He was
there constantly involved in theological controversies with the
surrounding clergy, and it was owing to their hostility that he
had to leave Gloucestershire. He then resolved to open their
eyes to the serious corruptions and decline of the church by
translating the New Testament into the vernacular. In order
to carry out this purpose he repaired in July or August 1523 to
London, and to the famous protector of scholars and scholarship,
Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall. His reception was, however, cold,
the bishop advising him to seek a livelihood in the town. During
a year of anxious waiting, it became clear to him &ldquo;not only
that there was no rowme in my lorde of londons palace to
translate the new testament, but also that there was no place
to do it in all englonde.&rdquo;<a name="fa18b" id="fa18b" href="#ft18b"><span class="sp">18</span></a> In May 1524 he consequently
betook himself to Hamburg, his resolution to carry out his great
work never for a moment flagging, and it was probably during
his stay in this free city and in Wittenberg, where he may have
been stimulated by Luther, that his translation of the New
Testament was actually made. At all events there is no doubt
that in 1525 he was in Cologne, engaged in printing at the press
of Peter Quentel a quarto edition of the New Testament. This
edition was provided with prefaces and marginal glosses. He
had advanced as far as the tenth sheet, bearing the signature
K, when his work was discovered by Johann Cochlaeus (<i>q.v.</i>),
a famous controversialist and implacable enemy of the Reformation,
who not only caused the Senate of Cologne to prohibit
the continuation of the printing, but also communicated with
Henry VIII. and Wolsey, warning them to stop the importation
of the work at the English seaports. Tyndale and his assistant,
William Roye, managed, however, to escape higher up the Rhine
to Worms, and they succeeded in carrying with them some or
all of the sheets which had been printed. Instead of completing
Quentel&rsquo;s work, Peter Schoeffer, the Worms printer, was employed
to print another impression of 3000 in a small octavo
size, without prefaces to the books or annotations in the margin,
and only having an address &ldquo;To the Reder&rdquo; at the end in
addition to the New Testament itself. Two impressions, the
quarto having possibly been completed by Schoeffer, arrived
in England early in the summer of 1526, and were eagerly
welcomed and bought. Such strong measures of suppression
were, however, at once adopted against these perilous volumes,
that of the quarto only a single fragment remains (Matt, i.-xxii.
12), now preserved in the British Museum (Grenville, 12179),<a name="fa19b" id="fa19b" href="#ft19b"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
of the octavo only one perfect copy (the title-page missing) in
the Baptist College at Bristol,<a name="fa20b" id="fa20b" href="#ft20b"><span class="sp">20</span></a> and one imperfect in the library
of St Paul&rsquo;s cathedral.</p>

<p>But Tyndale continued his labours undaunted. In 1529 the
manuscript translation of Deuteronomy is mentioned as having
perished with his other books and papers in a shipwreck which
he suffered on the coast of Holland, on his way to Hamburg.
In 1530, however, the whole of the <i>Pentateuch</i> was printed in
Marburg by Hans Luft; it is provided with prefaces and marginal
annotations of a strongly controversial character. The
only perfect copy is preserved in the Grenville library of the
British Museum.<a name="fa21b" id="fa21b" href="#ft21b"><span class="sp">21</span></a> It was reissued in 1534 with a new preface
and certain corrections and emendations in Genesis, and again
in London in 1551.</p>

<p>In 1531 the <i>Book of Jonah</i> appeared with an important and
highly interesting prologue, the only copy known of which is in
the British Museum.<a name="fa22b" id="fa22b" href="#ft22b"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the demand for New Testaments, for reading or
for the flames, steadily increased, and the printers found it to
their advantage to issue the Worms edition of the New Testament
in not less than three surreptitious reprints before 1534.
This is testified by George Joye in his <i>Apology</i>, who himself
brought out a fourth edition of Tyndale&rsquo;s New Testament in
August 1534, freed from many of the errors which, through
the carelessness of the Flemish printers, had crept into the text,
but with such alterations and new renderings as to arouse the
indignation of Tyndale. The only remaining copy, a 16mo, is
in the Grenville library. To counteract and supersede all these
unauthorized editions, Tyndale himself brought out his own
revision of the New Testament with translations added of all
the <i>Epistles of the Old Testament</i> after the use of Salisbury.
It was published in November 1534 at Antwerp by Martin
Emperowr. Prologues were added to all books except the Acts
and the Apocalypse, and new marginal glosses were introduced.
Three copies of this edition are in the British Museum, and it
was reprinted in 1841 in Bagster&rsquo;s <i>Hexapla</i>. In the following
year Tyndale once more set forth a revised edition, &ldquo;fynesshed
in the yere of oure Lorde God A.M.D. and XXXV.,&rdquo; and printed
at Antwerp by Godfried van der Haghen.<a name="fa23b" id="fa23b" href="#ft23b"><span class="sp">23</span></a> In this headings
were added to the chapters in the Gospels and the Acts, and
the marginal notes of the edition of 1534 were omitted. It
is chiefly noted for the peculiarities of its orthography. Of this
edition one copy is in the University library, Cambridge, a
second in Exeter College, Oxford, and a fragment in the British
Museum. It is supposed to have been revised by Tyndale while
in prison in the castle of Vilvorde, being the last of his labours
in connexion with the English Bible. His execution took place
on the 6th of October 1536, and about the same time a small
folio reprint of his revised edition of 1534 was brought out in
England, the first volume of Scripture printed in this country,
probably by T. Berthelet.<a name="fa24b" id="fa24b" href="#ft24b"><span class="sp">24</span></a> A perfect copy is found in the
Bodleian library. In later years, between 1536 and 1550,
numerous editions of Tyndale&rsquo;s New Testament were printed,
twenty-one of which have been enumerated and fully described
by Francis Fry.<a name="fa25b" id="fa25b" href="#ft25b"><span class="sp">25</span></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The history of our English Bible begins with the work of
Tyndale and not with that of Wycliffe,&rdquo; says Dr Westcott in his
<i>History of the English Bible</i>, p. 316, and it is true that one of the
most striking features of the work of Tyndale is its independence.
Attempts have been made to show that especially in the Old
Testament he based a great deal of his work on the Wycliffite
translations, but in face of this we have his own explicit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page899" id="page899"></a>899</span>
statement, &ldquo;I had no man to counterfet, nether was holpe with
englysshe of eny that had interpreted the same (<i>i.e.</i> the New
Testament), or soche lyke th&#299;ge &#299; the scripture beforetyme.&rdquo;<a name="fa26b" id="fa26b" href="#ft26b"><span class="sp">26</span></a></p>

<p>He translated straight from the Hebrew and Greek originals,
although the Vulgate and more especially Erasmus&rsquo;s Latin
version were on occasion consulted. For his prefaces and
marginal notes he used Luther&rsquo;s Bible freely, even to paraphrasing
or verbally translating long passages from it.</p>

<p>Apart from certain blemishes and awkward and even incorrect
renderings, Tyndale&rsquo;s translation may be described as a truly
noble work, faithful and scholarly, though couched in simple
and popular language. Surely no higher praise can be accorded
to it than that it should have been taken as a basis by the
translators of the Authorized Version, and thus have lived on
through the centuries up to the present day.</p>

<p>The following specimens may prove of interest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="center"><i>The thryde Chapter.</i></p>

<p>(Matthew iii. 1-4.) In those dayes Ihon the baptyser cam and
preached in the wyldernes of Iury, saynge, Repent, the kyngedom
of heven ys at hond. Thys ys he of whom it ys spoken be the
prophet Isay, whych sayth: the voice of a cryer in wyldernes, prepaire
ye the lordes waye, and make hys pathes strayght. Thys

about hys loynes. Hys meate was locustes * and wyldhe ony.</p>

<p>* &ldquo;Locustes are more then oware greshoppers, souche men vse
to eate in divres parties of the est&rdquo; (marginal note).</p>

<p>(Matthew vi. 9-13.) O oure father which art in heven, halewed

in erth, as hit ys in heven. Geve vs this daye oure dayly breade.
And forgeve vs oure treaspases, even as we forgeve them whych
treaspas vs. Lede vs nott in to temptacion, but delyvre vs from

</div>

<p>Meanwhile a complete English Bible was being prepared by
Miles Coverdale (<i>q.v.</i>), an Augustinian friar who was afterwards
for a few years (1551-1553) bishop of Exeter. As the
printing was finished on the 4th of October 1535 it
<span class="sidenote">Miles Coverdale.</span>
is evident that Coverdale must have been engaged
on the preparation of the work for the press at almost as
early a date as Tyndale. Foxe states (<i>op. cit.</i> v. 120) that
Coverdale was with Tyndale at Hamburg in 1529, and it is
probable that most of his time before 1535 was spent abroad,
and that his translation, like that of Tyndale, was done out of
England.</p>

<p>In 1877 Henry Stevens, in his catalogue of the Caxton Exhibition,
pointed out a statement by a certain Simeon Ruytinck in
his life of Emanuel van Meteren, appended to the latter&rsquo;s <i>Nederlandische
Historie</i> (1614), that Jacob van Meteren, the father of
Emanuel, had manifested great zeal in producing at Antwerp
a translation of the Bible into English, and had employed for
that purpose a certain learned scholar named Miles Conerdale
(<i>sic</i>). In 1884 further evidence was adduced by W.J.C. Moens,
who reprinted an affidavit signed by Emanuel van Meteren,
28 May 1609, to the effect that &ldquo;he was brought to England
<i>anno</i> 1550 ... by his father, a furtherer of reformed
religion, and he that caused the first Bible at his costes to be
Englisshed by Mr Myles Coverdal in Andwarp, the w&rsquo;h his
father, with Mr Edward Whytchurch, printed both in Paris
and London&rdquo; (<i>Registers of the Dutch Reformed Church, Austin
Friars</i>, 1884, p. xiv.). Apart from the reference to Whytchurch
and the place of printing, this statement agrees with that of
Simeon Ruytinck, and it is possible that van Meteren showed
his zeal in the matter by undertaking the cost of printing the
work as well as that of remunerating the translator. Mr W.
Aldis Wright, however, judging from the facts that the name of
Whytchurch was introduced, that the places of printing were
given as London and Paris, not Antwerp, and lastly that Emanuel
van Meteren being born in 1535 could only have derived his
knowledge from hearsay, is inclined to think that the Bible in
which J. van Meteren was interested &ldquo;was Matthew&rsquo;s of 1537
or the Great Bible of 1539, and not Coverdale&rsquo;s of 1535.&rdquo;<a name="fa27b" id="fa27b" href="#ft27b"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

<p>It is highly probable that the printer of Coverdale&rsquo;s Bible was
Christopher Froschouer of Zürich,<a name="fa28b" id="fa28b" href="#ft28b"><span class="sp">28</span></a> who printed the edition of
1550, and that the sheets were sent for binding and distribution
to James Nicolson, the Southwark printer.<a name="fa29b" id="fa29b" href="#ft29b"><span class="sp">29</span></a> This first of all
printed English Bibles is a small folio in German black letter,
bearing the title: &ldquo;<i>Biblia, The Bible</i>; that is, the Holy Scripture
of the Olde and New Testament, faithfully and truly
translated out of Douche (German) and Latyn into Englishe,
M.D.XXXV.&rdquo; The volume is provided with woodcuts and
initials, the title-page and preliminary matter in the only two
remaining copies (British Museum and Holkam Hall) being in the
same type as the body of the book. A second issue of the same
date, 1535, has the title-page and the preliminary matter in
English type, and omits the words &ldquo;out of Douche and Latyn&rdquo;;
a third issue bears the date 1536. A second edition in folio,
&ldquo;newly oversene and corrected,&rdquo; was printed by Nicolson, with
English type, in 1537; and also in the same year, a third
edition in quarto. On the title-page of the latter were added
the significant words, &ldquo;set forth with the Kynge&rsquo;s moost gracious
licence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coverdale, however, was no independent translator. Indeed,
he disavows any such claim by stating expressly, in his dedication
to the king, &ldquo;I have with a cleare conscience purely &amp; faythfully
translated this out of fyue sundry interpreters, hauyng
onely the manyfest trueth of the scripture before myne eyes,&rdquo;
and in the Prologue he refers to his indebtedness to &ldquo;The Douche
(German) interpreters: whom (because of theyr synguler gyftes
and speciall diligence in The Bible) I haue ben the more glad
to folowe for the most parte, accordynge as I was requyred.&rdquo;<a name="fa30b" id="fa30b" href="#ft30b"><span class="sp">30</span></a>
These &ldquo;fyue interpreters&rdquo; Dr Westcott (<i>ibid.</i> p. 163) identifies
as Luther, the Zürich Bible, the Latin version of Pagninus, the
Vulgate, and, in all likelihood, the English translation of Tyndale.</p>

<p>Though not endowed with the strength and originality of mind
that characterized Tyndale&rsquo;s work, Coverdale showed great
discrimination in the handling and use of his authorities, and
moreover a certain delicacy and happy ease in his rendering of
the Biblical text, to which we owe not a few of the beautiful
expressions of our present Bible.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the edition of 1535 may serve as
examples of his rendering:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="center"><i>The first psalme.</i></p>

<p>(i. 1-2.) Blessed is þe man, þe goeth not in the councell of þe ungodly:
þe abydeth not in the waye off synners, &amp; sytteth not in þe
seate of the scornefull. But delyteth in the lawe of þe Lorde, &amp;
exercyseth himself in his lawe both daye and night.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The gospell of S. Mathew.</i></p>

<p>(iii. 1-4.) In those dayes Ihon the Baptyst came and preached in
the wildernes of Jury, saynge: Amende youre selues, the kyngdome
of heuen is at honde. This is he, of whom it is spoken by the
prophet Esay, which sayeth: The voyce of a cryer in þe wyldernes,
prepare the <i>Lordes</i> waye, and make his pathes straight. This Ihon
had his garment of camels heer, and a lethren gerdell aboute his
loynes. Hys meate was locustes and wylde hony.</p>
</div>

<p>It should be added that Coverdale&rsquo;s Bible was the first in
which the non-canonical books were left out of the body of the
Old Testament and placed by themselves at the end of it under
the title <i>Apocripha</i>.</p>

<p>The large sale of the New Testaments of Tyndale, and the
success of Coverdale&rsquo;s Bible, showed the London booksellers
that a new and profitable branch of business was
opened out to them, and they soon began to avail
<span class="sidenote">Matthew&rsquo;s Bible.</span>
themselves of its advantages. Richard Grafton and
Edward Whitchurch were the first in the field, bringing out
a fine and full-sized folio in 1537, &ldquo;truely and purely translated
into English by Thomas Matthew.&rdquo; Thomas Matthew,
is, however, in all probability, an alias for John Rogers, a
friend and fellow-worker of Tyndale, and the volume is in
reality no new translation at all, but a compilation from the
renderings of Tyndale and Coverdale. Thus the Pentateuch
and the New Testament were reprinted from Tyndale&rsquo;s translations
of 1530 and 1535 respectively, with very slight variations;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page900" id="page900"></a>900</span>
the books from Joshua to the end of Chronicles are traditionally,
and lately also by external evidence,<a name="fa31b" id="fa31b" href="#ft31b"><span class="sp">31</span></a> assigned to Tyndale and
were probably left by him in the hands of Rogers. From Ezra
to Malachi the translation is taken from Coverdale, as is also
that of the Apocryphal books. John Roger&rsquo;s own work appears
in a marginal commentary distributed through the Old and
New Testaments and chiefly taken from Olivetan&rsquo;s French Bible
of 1535. The volume was printed in black letter in double
columns, and three copies are preserved in the British Museum.
In 1538 a second edition in folio appeared; it was reprinted twice
in 1549, and again in 1551. It is significant that this Bible,
like Coverdale&rsquo;s second edition, was &ldquo;set forth with the kinges
most gracyous lycence,&rdquo; probably with the concurrence of
Cranmer, since he, in a letter to Cromwell, begged him to
&ldquo;exhibit the book unto the king&rsquo;s highness, and to obtain
of his grace ... a licence that the same may be sold and
read of every person, without danger of any act, proclamation
or ordinance, heretofore granted to the contrary.&rdquo;<a name="fa32b" id="fa32b" href="#ft32b"><span class="sp">32</span></a> And thus
it came to pass, as Dr Westcott strikingly puts it, that &ldquo;by
Cranmer&rsquo;s petition, by Crumwell&rsquo;s influence, and by Henry&rsquo;s
authority, without any formal ecclesiastical decision, the book
was given to the English people, which is the foundation of the
text of our present Bible. From Matthew&rsquo;s Bible&mdash;itself a
combination of the labours of Tyndale and Coverdale&mdash;all later
revisions have been successively formed&rdquo; (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 71).</p>

<p>Meanwhile the successful sale of Matthew&rsquo;s Bible, the private
venture of the two printers Grafton and Whitchurch, was threatened
by a rival edition published in 1539 in folio and
quarto by &ldquo;John Byddell for Thomas Barthlet&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">Taverner.</span>
with Richard Taverner as editor. This was, in fact, what
would now be called &ldquo;piracy,&rdquo; being Grafton&rsquo;s <i>Matthew Bible</i>
revised by Taverner, a learned member of the Inner Temple and
famous Greek scholar. He made many alterations in the Matthew
Bible, characterized by critical acumen and a happy choice of
strong and idiomatic expressions. He is, perhaps, the first
purist among the Biblical translators, endeavouring, whenever
possible, to substitute a word of native origin for the foreign
expression of his predecessors.<a name="fa33b" id="fa33b" href="#ft33b"><span class="sp">33</span></a> His revision seems, however,
to have had little or no influence on subsequent translators,
and was only once, in 1549, reprinted in its entirety. Quarto
and octavo editions of the New Testament alone were published
in the same year, 1539, as the original edition, and in the following
year, 1540, the New Testament in duodecimo. The Old Testament
was reprinted as part of a Bible in 1551, but no other
editions are known than those named.</p>

<p>It will have been observed that the translations of Holy
Scripture which had been printed during these years (1525-1539)
were all made by private men and printed without any
public authority. Some of them had indeed been set
<span class="sidenote">The Great Bible, 1539.</span>
forth by the king&rsquo;s licence, but the object of this is
shown by the above-quoted letter of Archbishop
Cranmer to Cromwell, touching Matthew&rsquo;s Bible. It is &ldquo;that the
same may be sold and read of every person ... until such time
that we, the bishops, shall set forth a better translation, which I
think will not be till a day after doomsday.&rdquo; This letter was
written on the 4th of August 1537, and the impatient words at
the end refer to an authorized version which had been projected
several years before, and which was, in fact, at that very time
in preparation, though not proceeding quickly enough to satisfy
Cranmer. In the year 1530, Henry VIII. had issued a commission
of inquiry respecting the expediency and necessity of having
&ldquo;in the English tongue both the New Testament and the Old&rdquo;
(Wilkins&rsquo; <i>Concilia</i>, iii. 737). This commission reported against
the expediency of setting forth a vernacular translation until
there was a more settled state of religious opinion, but states
that the king &ldquo;intended to provide that the Holy Scripture shall
be, by great, learned and Catholic persons, translated into the
English tongue if it shall then seem to His Grace convenient to
be&rdquo; (<i>ib.</i> 740). The Convocation of Canterbury refreshed the
royal memory on the subject by petitioning the king on the
19th of December 1534 &ldquo;that His Majesty would vouchsafe
to decree, that the Scriptures should be translated into the
vulgar tongue ... and ... delivered to the people according
to their learning&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i> 770). The subject was again before
Convocation in 1536,<a name="fa34b" id="fa34b" href="#ft34b"><span class="sp">34</span></a> but the detailed history is lost to us&mdash;all
that is known being that Cromwell had placed Coverdale at the
head of the enterprise, and that the result was an entirely new
revision, based on Matthew&rsquo;s Bible.<a name="fa35b" id="fa35b" href="#ft35b"><span class="sp">35</span></a> Coverdale consulted in his
revision the Latin version of the Old Testament with the Hebrew
text by Sebastian Münster, the Vulgate and Erasmus&rsquo;s editions
of the Greek text for the New Testament.</p>

<p>Concerning the printing of this authorized Bible more details
are known. Cromwell had planned the work on a large scale,
too large evidently for the resources of the English presses, for
it was determined that the printing should be entrusted to
Francis Regnault, a famous Paris printer. At the request of
Henry VIII., a licence was granted to Regnault for this purpose
by Francis I., while Coverdale and Grafton were sent over in
1538 to superintend the work as it passed through the press.
The work was pressed forward with all speed, for, as Coverdale
writes to Cromwell, they were &ldquo;dayly threatened&rdquo; and ever
feared &ldquo;to be spoken withall.&rdquo;<a name="fa36b" id="fa36b" href="#ft36b"><span class="sp">36</span></a> Indeed, when the printing
was far advanced, on the 17th of December 1538, its further
progress was interdicted by the Inquisitor-general for France,
and orders were given to seize the whole of the impression.
Coverdale and Grafton left Paris quickly, but soon returned,
rescued a great number of the finished sheets, &ldquo;four great dry-vats&rdquo;
full of them having been sold to a haberdasher instead
of being burnt&mdash;and conveyed types, printing-presses and
workmen to England. Thus the volume which had been begun
in Paris in 1538 was completed in London, the colophon stating
that it was &ldquo;Fynisshed in Apryll, <i>Anno</i> M.CCCCC.XXXIX.&rdquo;
It is a splendid folio Bible of the largest volume, and was distinguished
from its predecessors by the name of <i>The Great Bible</i>.
The title-page represents Henry VIII. giving the &ldquo;Word of God&rdquo;
to Cromwell and Cranmer, who, in their order, distribute it to
laymen and clerics, and describes the volume as &ldquo;truly translated
after the veryte of the Hebreue and Greke texts by þe dylygent
studye of dyverse excellent learned men, expert in the forsayde
tongues. Prynted by Rychard Grafton and Edward
Whitchurch.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certain godly annotations,&rdquo; which Coverdale
promised in the Prologue, did not, however, appear in the first
issue, nor in any of the following. This was the first of seven
editions of this noble Bible which issued from the press during
the years 1539-1541,&mdash;the second of them, that of 1540, called
<i>Cranmer&rsquo;s Bible</i> from the fact that it contained a long Preface
by Archbishop Cranmer, having the important addition &ldquo;This
is the Byble apoynted to the vse of the churches&rdquo; on the title-page.
Seventy years afterwards it assumed the form ever since
known as the <i>Authorized Version</i>, but its Psalter is still embedded,
without any alteration, in the Book of Common Prayer.</p>

<p>For the sake of comparison the following extracts from St
Matthew are given, according to the edition of 1539.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(Matthew iii. 1-4.) In those dayes came Iohn the Baptyst, preaching
in the wyldernes of Iewry, saying, Repent of the life that is past,
for the kyngdome of heauen is at hande, For thys is he, of whom the
prophet Esay spake, which sayeth, the voyce of a cryer in the wyldernes,
prepare ye the waye of the lorde: make hys pathes strayght.
Thys Iohn had hys garment of camels heer And a gyrdell of a skynne
aboute hys loynes. His meate was locustes and wylde hony.</p>

<p>(Matthew vi. 9-13.) Oure father which art in heauen, halowed
be thy name. Let thy kingdome come. Thy will be fulfilled, as well
in erth, as it is in heuen. Geue vs this daye oure dayly bred. And
forgeue vs oure dettes, as we forgeue oure detters. And leade vs
not into temptation: but delyuer vs from euyll. For thyne is the
kyngdom and the power, and the glorye for euer. Amen.</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the closing years of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s reign were
characterized by restrictive measures as to the reading and use
of the Bible. Tyndale Version was prohibited by an act of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page901" id="page901"></a>901</span>
parliament, 1543; at the same time it was enacted that all notes
and marginal commentaries in other copies should be obliterated,
and that &ldquo;no woman (unless she be a noble or gentle woman),
no artificers, apprentices, journeymen, servingmen, under the
degree of yeomen ... husbandmen or labourers&rdquo; should read or
use any part of the Bible under pain of fines and imprisonment.<a name="fa37b" id="fa37b" href="#ft37b"><span class="sp">37</span></a></p>

<p>In 1546 Coverdale&rsquo;s Bible was included in the proscription,
the <i>Great Bible</i> being the only translation not interdicted.
During Edward VI.&rsquo;s reign there was a brief respite,
but with the accession of Mary the persecutions of the
<span class="sidenote">William Whittingham.</span>
English Bible and its friends were renewed. Cranmer
suffered martyrdom at the stake, as John Rogers had
done before him. Other prominent reformers, amongst them
Coverdale, sought refuge in Geneva, the town of Calvin and Beza,
where they employed their enforced leisure in planning and
carrying out a new revision of the Bible. The first fruits of these
labours was a New Testament issued in June 1557, with an
introduction by Calvin, probably the work of William Whittingham.<a name="fa38b" id="fa38b" href="#ft38b"><span class="sp">38</span></a>
The volume, in a convenient quarto size, printed in clear
Roman type, and provided with marginal annotations, gained immediate
popularity in England, where a Bible suited for household
demands had long been needed. It was the first Bible which
had the text divided into &ldquo;verses and sections according to the
best editions in other languages.&rdquo;<a name="fa39b" id="fa39b" href="#ft39b"><span class="sp">39</span></a></p>

<p>Whittingham&rsquo;s enterprise was, however, soon superseded by
an issue of the whole Bible, which appeared in 1560, the so-called
<i>Genevan Bible</i>, popularly also known as the <i>Breeches
Bible</i>, from its rendering of Gen. iii. 7, &ldquo;They sewed
<span class="sidenote">The Genevan Bible.</span>
fig leaves together and made themselves breeches.&rdquo;
This edition was mainly due to the combined efforts
of William Whittingham, Anthony Gilby and Thomas Sampson,
and the expenses towards printing and publication were borne
by members of the congregation at Geneva. It represented in
the Old Testament a thorough and independent revision of the
text of the <i>Great Bible</i> with the help of the Hebrew original,
the Latin versions of Leo Judä (1543), Pagninus (1528), Sebastian
Münster (1534-1535), and the French versions of Olivetan.
The New Testament consisted of Tyndale&rsquo;s latest text revised
to a great extent in accordance with Beza&rsquo;s translation and
commentary. The changes introduced by the Genevan translators
were, as a rule, a great improvement, and the version
received a ready welcome and immediate popularity, not only
on account of its intrinsic merits, but because of its handy size,
usually that of a small quarto, and of its being printed, like
Whittingham&rsquo;s New Testament, in a readable Roman type
instead of black letter. Like this earlier publication, it had the
division of the chapters into verses, and a marginal commentary
which proved a great attraction to the Puritans. The popularity
of the Genevan Bible was so great that between 1560 and 1644
at least 140 editions of it were published,<a name="fa40b" id="fa40b" href="#ft40b"><span class="sp">40</span></a> and this in spite of its
not being allowed for use in the churches.</p>

<p>In 1576 the New Testament of the Genevan Bible was again
revised by Lawrence Tomson and provided with a new commentary
mainly translated from Beza. It soon became popular
and even replaced the Genevan New Testament in later editions
of this Bible.</p>

<p>Some time after the accession of Queen Elizabeth an attempt
was made to improve the authorized <i>Great Bible</i>, and in this
way to challenge the ever growing popularity of the
Calvinistic <i>Genevan Bible</i>. The initiative was taken
<span class="sidenote">The Bishops&rsquo; Bible.</span>
by Archbishop Parker, about 1563-1565, who, according
to Strype (Parker i. 414) &ldquo;took upon him the
labour to contrive and set the whole work a going ... by sorting
out the whole Bible into parcels ... and distributing these
parcels to able bishops and other learned men, to peruse and
collate each the book or books allotted them ... and they to
add some short marginal notes for the illustration or correction
of the text.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The rules upon which they proceeded were these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. &ldquo;To follow the common English translation used in the
churches, and not to recede from it, but where it varieth manifestly
from the Hebrew or Greek original. 2. To use sections and divisions
in the text as Pagnine in his translation useth, and for the verity
of the Hebrew to follow the said Pagnine and Münster specially,
and generally others learned in the tongues. 3. To make no bitter
notes upon any text, or yet to set down any determination in places
of controversy. 4. To note such chapters and places as contain
matters of genealogies, or other such places not edifying, with some
strike or note, that the reader may eschew them in his public reading.
5. That all such words as sound in the old translation to any
offence of lightness or obscenity be expressed with more convenient
terms and phrases.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The work was pushed forward with energy, and on the 5th
of October 1568 the volume was ready for publication. It
was a magnificent folio, generally known as the <i>Bishops&rsquo; Bible</i>,
since not less than eight of these dignitaries took part in the
revision. But the detached and piecemeal way in which the
revision had been carried out naturally caused certain inequalities
in the execution of the work. The different parts of
the Bible vary considerably in merit, the alterations in the New
Testament, for instance, showing freshness and vigour, whereas
most of the changes introduced in the Old Testament have been
condemned as &ldquo;arbitrary and at variance with the exact sense
of the Hebrew text&rdquo; (Westcott, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 237). Several editions
of the <i>Bishops&rsquo; Bible</i> were afterwards published, but it is doubtful
whether the ecclesiastical authorities in spite of repeated
enactments (Cardwell, <i>Synodalia</i>, pp. 115, 123, 210, 292) ever
succeeded in entirely enforcing its public use in the churches.
After 1569 the Great Bible ceased, however, to be reprinted.
But in the homes the Genevan version still maintained its
supremacy. One thing is certain, that the book of Psalms of
the new revision had fairly soon to give way before the well-known
and smooth rendering of the Great Bible. In the second
edition of the Bishops&rsquo; Bible, 1572, the two texts were actually
printed side by side; in all later editions except one (1585) the
older Psalter alone remained.</p>

<p>From the time of Tyndale onwards the translation of the
Scriptures into English had been more or less an outcome of
the great reformatory movements within the church.
It was not until Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign that members
<span class="sidenote">The Reims and Douai Version.</span>
of the Romanist party found it expedient to translate the
Bible into the vernacular &ldquo;for the more speedy abolishing
of a number of false and impious translations put forth by
sundry sectes, and for the better preseruation or reclaime of many
good soules endangered thereby&rdquo; (<i>Preface</i> to the Rhemish
Version).</p>

<p>According to the title-page the New Testament was &ldquo;translated
faithfvlly into English ovt of the authentical Latin, according
to the best corrected copies of the same, diligently conferred
vvith the Greeke and other editions in diuers languages.... In
the English College of Rhemes, 1582.&rdquo; The Old Testament
had been &ldquo;long since&rdquo; completed, but &ldquo;for lacke of good
meanes&rdquo; (Preface to the New Testament), its appearance was
delayed till 1609-1610, when it was published at Douai. The
complete work, known as the <i>Rhemes and Douay Version</i>, was
reprinted in Rouen in 1635, and after a considerable time revised
by Dr Challoner (1749-1750). The translation is really anonymous,
but there seems to be little doubt that it was carried out
by some of the Romanist refugees connected with the Seminary
at Douai and the English college at Reims, the chief amongst
them being Gregory Martin, William Allen, Richard Bristow
and J. Reynolds. Like the Wycliffite Versions it is merely a
secondary rendering from the Latin Vulgate, and it suffered from
many of the defects which characterized these versions, extreme
literalness, often stilted, ambiguous renderings, at times unintelligible
except by a reference to the Latin original, as in
Luke xxii. 18, &ldquo;I will not drink of the generation of the vine,&rdquo;
or Phil. ii. 7, &ldquo;But he exinanited himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page902" id="page902"></a>902</span></p>

<p>As further examples of this rendering we print the same
passages from St Matthew:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(Matthew iii. 1-4.) And in those dayes cometh Iohn the Baptist
preaching in the desert of Ievvrie, saying. Doe penance: for the
Kingdom of heauen is at hand. For this is he that vvas spoken of
by Esay the Prophet, saying, A voyce of one crying in the desert,
prepare ye the way of our Lord, make straight his pathes. And the
sayd Iohn had his garment of camels heare, &amp; a girdle of a skinne
about his loynes: and his meate was locustes &amp; vvilde honie.</p>

<p>(Matthew vi. 9-13.) Ovr Father which art in heauen, sanctified
be thy name. Let thy Kingdom come. Thy wil be done, as in
heauen, in earth also. Giue vs to day our supersubstantial bread.
And forgiue vs our dettes, as we also forgiue our detters. And leade
vs not into tentation. But deliuer vs from evil. Amen.</p>
</div>

<p>The strongly Latinized vocabulary of this version was not
without its influence on the next great venture in English
translations of the Bible, the <i>Authorized Version</i>.<a name="fa41b" id="fa41b" href="#ft41b"><span class="sp">41</span></a></p>

<p>The English Bible, which is now recognized as the <i>Authorized
Version</i> wherever the English language is spoken, is a revision
of the Bishops&rsquo; Bible, begun in 1604, and published
in 1611. It arose incidentally out of a Conference
<span class="sidenote">The Authorized Version, 1611.</span>
between the High Church and the Low Church parties
convened by James I. at Hampton Court Palace in
January 1604, for the purpose of determining &ldquo;things pretended
to be amiss in the church,&rdquo; and was originally proposed by
Dr Reynolds, president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, the
leader and spokesman of the Low Church party, and subsequently
on the committee which revised the translation of
the Prophets.</p>

<p>No real opposition was offered to the proposal, and the king
cleverly sketched out on the moment a plan to be adopted.
He &ldquo;wished that some special pains should be taken in that
behalf for one uniform translation&mdash;professing that he could
never yet see a Bible well translated in English&mdash;and this to be
done by the best learned in both the Universities; after them
to be reviewed by the bishops and the chief learned of the
Church; from them to be presented to the privy council; and
lastly to be ratified by his royal authority; and so this whole
church to be bound unto it and none other.&rdquo;<a name="fa42b" id="fa42b" href="#ft42b"><span class="sp">42</span></a> He also
particularly desired that no notes should be added by way of
comment in the margin, since some of those in the Genevan
Bible appeared to him &ldquo;very partial, untrue, seditious and
savouring too much of dangerous and traiterous conceits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The appointment of the revisers was a work of much responsibility
and labour, and five months elapsed before they were
selected and their respective portions assigned to them; but
the list of those who began the work, and who, with some few
changes in consequence of deaths, brought it to a happy conclusion,
shows how large an amount of scholarship was enlisted.
It includes Dr Andrewes, afterwards bishop of Winchester,
who was familiar with Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Greek, Latin
and at least ten other languages, while his knowledge of patristic
literature was unrivalled; Dr Overall, regius professor of theology
and afterwards bishop of Norwich; Bedwell, the greatest Arabic
scholar of Europe; Sir Henry Savile, the most learned layman
of his time; and, to say nothing of others well known to later
generations, nine who were then or afterwards professors of
Hebrew or of Greek at Oxford or Cambridge. It is observable
also that they were chosen without reference to party, at least
as many of the Puritan clergy as of the opposite party being
placed on the committees.</p>

<p>When this large body of scholars were set down to their task,
an elaborate set of rules was drawn up for their guidance,
which contained a scheme of revision as well as general directions
for the execution of their work. This is one of the very
few records that remain of their undertaking.<a name="fa44b" id="fa44b" href="#ft44b"><span class="sp">44</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;(1) The ordinary Bible read in the Church, commonly called
&lsquo;the Bishops&rsquo; Bible,&rsquo; to be followed, and as little altered as the truth
of the original will permit. (2) The names of the prophets and the
holy writers, with the other names of the text to be retained as nigh
as may be, accordingly as they were vulgarly used. (3) The old
ecclesiastical words to be kept, viz. the word <i>Church</i> not to be translated
<i>Congregation</i>, &amp;c. (4) When a word hath divers significations,
that to be kept which hath been most commonly used by the most of
the ancient fathers, being agreeable to the propriety of the place and
the analogy of the faith. (5) The division of the chapters to be
altered either not at all or as little as may be, if necessity so require.
(6) No marginal notes at all to be affixed, but only for the explanation
of the Hebrew or Greek words which cannot, without some circumlocution,
so briefly and fitly be expressed in the text. (7) Such
quotations of places to be marginally set down as shall serve for the
fit reference of one Scripture to another. (8) Every particular man
of each company to take the same chapter or chapters; and having
translated or amended them severally by himself where he thinketh
good, all to meet together, confer what they have done, and agree
for their parts what shall stand. (9) As any one company hath
dispatched any one book in this manner, they shall send it to the
rest to be considered of seriously and judiciously, for his majesty
is very careful in this point. (10) If any company, upon the review
of the book so sent, doubt or differ upon any place, to send them
word thereof, note the place, and withal send the reasons; to which
if they consent not, the difference to be compounded at the general
meeting, which is to be of the chief persons of each company at the
end of the work. (11) When any place of special obscurity is doubted
of, letters to be directed by authority to send to any learned man in
the land for his judgment of such a place. (12) Letters to be sent
from every bishop to the rest of his clergy, admonishing them of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page903" id="page903"></a>903</span>
translation in hand, and to move and charge as many as being skilful
in the tongues and having taken pains in that kind, to send his
particular observations to the company either at Westminster,
Cambridge or Oxford. (13) The directors in each company to the
deans of Westminster and Chester for that place; and the king&rsquo;s
professors in the Hebrew or Greek in either university. (14) These
translations to be used when they agree better with the text than
the Bishops&rsquo; Bible; viz. Tyndale&rsquo;s, Matthew&rsquo;s, Coverdale&rsquo;s, Whitchurch&rsquo;s,
Geneva. (15) Besides the said directors before mentioned,
three or four of the most ancient and grave divines in either of the
universities, not employed in translating, to be assigned by the vice-chancellor
upon conference with [the] rest of the heads to be overseers
of the translations, as well Hebrew as Greek, for the better
observation of the fourth rule above specified.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It is not possible to determine in how far all these rules were
adhered to. All we know of the way this noble work was carried
out is contained in the Preface, where Dr Miles Smith, in 1612
bishop of Gloucester, in the name of his fellow-workers gives an
account of the manner and spirit in which it was done:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Neither did we run ouer the worke with that posting haste
that the <i>Septuagint</i> did, if that be true which is reported of them,
that they finished it in 72 days.... The worke hath ... cost the
workemen, as light as it seemeth, the paines of twise seuen times
seuentie two dayes and more.... Truly (good Christian Reader),
we neuer thought from the beginning, that we should neede to make
a new Translation, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one...
but to make a good one better, or out of many good ones, one principall
good one, not iustly to be excepted against.... To that purpose
there were many chosen, that were greater in other mens eyes than
in their owne, and that sought the truth rather than their own
praise.... Neither did wee thinke much to consult the Translators
or Commentators, <i>Chaldee, Hebrewe, Syrian, Greeke</i>, or <i>Latine</i>, no
mor the <i>Spanish, French, Italian</i> or <i>Dutch</i> [German]; neither did we
disdaine to reuise that which we had done, and to bring back to the
anuitl that which we had hammered: but hauing and vsing as great
helpes as were needfull, and fearing no reproch for slownesse, nor
coueting praise for expedition, wee haue at the length, through the
good hand of the Lord vpon vs, brought the worke to that passe
that you see.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>From the above it appears that the actual work of revision
occupied about two years and nine months, an additional nine
months being required for the final preparation for press. The
edition appeared at length in 1611, the full title being as follows:
The Holy Bible, conteyning the Old Testament, and the New:
Newly Translated out of the Originall tongues, &amp; with the former
Translations diligently compared and reuised, by his Maiesties
speciall comandement. Appointed to be read in Churches.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings
most Excellent Maiestie. <i>Anno Dom</i>. 1611.<a name="fa45b" id="fa45b" href="#ft45b"><span class="sp">45</span></a> Since that time
many millions of this revised translation have been printed,
and the general acceptance of it by all English-speaking people
of whatever denomination is a testimony to its excellence.</p>

<p>Still the work of improving and correcting went on through the
centuries, and a modern copy of the Authorized Version shows
no inconsiderable departures from the standard edition of 1611.
Dr Scrivener imputes some of those differences &ldquo;to oversight
and negligence ... but much the greater part of them&rdquo;
he holds to be &ldquo;deliberate changes, introduced silently and
without authority by men whose very names are often
unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="author">(A. C. P.)</div>

<p>More ambitious attempts at amending the new version were
not lacking, but they all proved fruitless, until in February 1870
the Convocation of Canterbury appointed a committee
to consider the subject of revision. The report of
<span class="sidenote">The Revised Version.</span>
this committee, presented in May, was adopted, to
the effect &ldquo;that Convocation should nominate a body
of its own members to undertake the work of revision, who shall
be at liberty to invite the co-operation of any eminent for scholarship,
to whatever nation or religious body they may belong&rdquo;;
and shortly afterwards two companies were formed for the revision
of the Authorized Version of the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p>Negotiations were opened with the leading scholars of the
Protestant denominations in America, with the result that
similar companies were formed in the United States. The work
of the English revisers was regularly submitted to their consideration;
their comments were carefully considered and largely
adopted, and their divergences from the version ultimately agreed
upon were printed in an appendix to the published work. Thus
the Revised Version was the achievement of English-speaking
Christendom as a whole; only the Roman Catholic Church, of
the great English-speaking denominations, refused to take part
in the undertaking. The Church of England, which had put forth
the version of 1611, fitly initiated the work, but for its performance
most wisely invited the help of the sister churches. The delegates
of the Clarendon Press in Oxford, and the syndics of the Pitt
Press in Cambridge, entered into a liberal arrangement with the
revisers, by which the necessary funds were provided for all their
expenses. On the completion of its work the New Testament
company divided itself into three committees, working at London,
Westminster and Cambridge, for the purpose of revising the
Apocrypha.</p>

<p>The work of the Old Testament company was different in
some important respects from that which engaged the attention
of the New Testament company. The received Hebrew text
has undergone but little emendation, and the revisers had before
them substantially the same Massoretic text which was in the
hands of the translators of 1611. It was felt that there was no
sufficient justification to make any attempt at an entire reconstruction
of the text on the authority of the versions. The
Old Testament revisers were therefore spared much of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page904" id="page904"></a>904</span>
labour of deciding between different readings, which formed one
of the most important duties of the New Testament company.
But the advance in the study of Hebrew since the early part of
the 17th century enabled them to give a more faithful translation
of the received text. The value of their work is evident,
especially in Job, Ecclesiastes and the prophetical books.</p>

<p>It is the work of the New Testament committee which has
attracted most attention, whether for blame or praise. The
critical resources at the disposal of scholars in 1611 were very
meagre, and the few early manuscripts with which they were
acquainted failed to receive the attention they deserved. The
results of modern critical methods could not fail to make the
incompleteness of the &ldquo;Received Text,&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;Authorized
Version,&rdquo; which was based on it, obvious. It had long been the
opinion of all competent scholars that a thorough revision was
necessary. A proposal in favour of this course was made in
Convocation in 1856, but it was not until fourteen years later
that the committee was appointed to undertake the work. The
revisers&rsquo; first task was to reconstruct the Greek text, as the
necessary foundation of their work. In this difficult duty they
were no doubt influenced by Westcott and Hort&rsquo;s edition of the
New Testament. These two scholars were members of the
committee which prepared the Revised Version, and on the
question of various readings they appear to have exercised a
predominating influence. The revisers were privately supplied
with instalments of Westcott and Hort&rsquo;s text as their work
required them. But it is scarcely necessary to say that the
Revised Version is not the work of one or two scholars. Different
schools of criticism were represented on the committee, and the
most careful discussion took place before any decision was formed.
Every precaution was taken to ensure that the version should
represent the result of the best scholarship of the time, applied
to the work before it with constant devotion and with the
highest sense of responsibility. The changes in the Greek text of
the Authorized Version when compared with the <i>textus receptus</i>
are numerous, but the contrast between the English versions of
1611 and 1881 is all the more striking because of the difference
in the method of translation which was adopted. The revisers
aimed at the most scrupulous faithfulness. They adopted the
plan&mdash;deliberately rejected by the translators of 1611&mdash;of always
using the same English word for the same Greek word. &ldquo;They
endeavoured to enable the English reader to follow the correspondences
of the original with the closest exactness, to catch the
solemn repetition of words and phrases, to mark the subtleties of
expression, to feel even the strangeness of unusual forms of
speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The revision of the New Testament was completed in 407
meetings, distributed over more than ten years. It was formally
presented to Convocation on May 17, 1881. The revision of the Old
Testament occupied 792 days, and was finished on June 20, 1884.
The revised Apocrypha did not make its appearance until 1895.</p>

<p>The text of the Revised Version is printed in paragraphs, the
old division of books into chapters and verses being retained for
convenience of reference. By this arrangement the capricious
divisions of some books is avoided. Various editions of the
New Version have been published, the most complete being the
edition of the whole Bible with marginal references. These
references had their origin in the work of two small subcommittees
of the revisers, but they received their present form
at the hands of a specially appointed committee. The marginal
references given in the original edition of the Authorized Version
of 1611 have been retained as far as possible.</p>

<p>The work of the revisers was received without enthusiasm.
It was too thorough for the majority of religious people.
Partisans found that havoc had been played with their proof
texts. Ecclesiastical conservatives were scandalized by the
freedom with which the traditional text was treated. The
advocates of change were discontented with the hesitating
acceptance which their principles had obtained. The most
vulnerable side of the revision was that on which the mass of
English readers thought itself capable of forming a judgment.
The general effect of so many small alterations was to spoil
the familiar sonorous style of the Authorized Version. The changes
were freely denounced as equally petty and vexatious; they
were, moreover, too often inconsistent with the avowed principles
of the revisers. The method of determining readings and
renderings by vote was not favourable to the consistency and
literary character of the Version. A whole literature of criticism
and apology made its appearance, and the achievement of so
many years of patient labour seemed destined to perish in a storm
of resentments. On the whole, the Revised Version weathered
the storm more successfully than might have been expected. Its
considerable excellences were better realized by students than
stated by apologists. The hue and cry of the critics largely died
away, and was replaced by a calmer and juster appreciation.</p>

<p>The work of the revisers has been sharply criticized from the
standpoint of specialists in New Testament Greek. Dr Rutherford
stated the case briefly and pointedly in the preface to his
translation of the Epistle to the Romans (London, 1900). He
maintains that &ldquo;the Greek of the New Testament may never be
understood as classical Greek is understood,&rdquo; and accuses the
revisers of distorting the meaning &ldquo;by translating in accordance
with Attic idiom phrases that convey in later Greek a wholly
different sense, the sense which the earlier translators in happy
ignorance had recognized that the context demanded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The use of the new Version has become general. Familiarity
has mitigated the harshness of the revisers&rsquo; renderings; scholarship,
on the whole, has confirmed their readings. The Version
has been publicly read in parish churches both in London and in
the country. In Canterbury cathedral and Westminster Abbey
it has definitely displaced the older Version. Bishops have
acquiesced and congregations approved. It is no longer possible
to maintain the plausible and damaging contention that the
Revised Bible is ill suited for public use. The Upper House of
the Convocation of Canterbury in May 1898 appointed a committee
to consider the expediency of &ldquo;permitting or encouraging&rdquo;
the use of the Revised Version in the public services of the
Church.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIBLE CHRISTIANS,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> one of the denominations now merged
in the United Methodist Church (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">United Methodists</a></span>), so
called because its early preachers appealed solely to the Bible
in confirmation of their doctrines. The denomination arose in
the agricultural districts and fishing villages of north Cornwall
and Devon; a district only slightly influenced by John Wesley
and the original Methodist movement. The founder was
William O&rsquo;Bryan (afterwards Bryant), a Methodist lay preacher
of Luxillian, Cornwall. Finding that the people had no evangelical
preaching he began an itinerary to supply the need. The
coastmen were expert smugglers and wreckers, the agriculturists
were ignorant and drunken, the parish clergy were slothful, in
many cases intemperate, and largely given to fox-hunting. Only
in a parish or two was there any approach to religious ministry.
O&rsquo;Bryan commenced his labours in north Devon, and in 1815 a
small society was formed at Lake Farm, Shebbear. The movement
had the seeds of great vitality in it. In 1819 the first
conference was held at Launceston. There were present besides
O&rsquo;Bryan one accepted minister&mdash;James Thorne&mdash;fourteen ministers
on trial and fifteen women preachers, a class that was always
conspicuous in the denomination. At that conference the work
had spread from Ring&rsquo;s Ash in Devon to Morrah, a lonely and
desolate parish in west Cornwall. In 1820-1821 Kent, Northumberland,
the Scilly and Norman (<i>i.e.</i> Channel) Islands appeared
on the list of stations. Then came a serious break. In 1829
there was a severance between the larger part of the new body
and O&rsquo;Bryan, who had claimed to be perpetual president, and to
have all property vested in him personally. He tried to establish
a separate conference, but failed, and in 1836 there was a reunion.
O&rsquo;Bryan left England for America, where he remained for the
rest of his life, and his contingent (numbering 565 members
and 4 ministers) returned to the original conference. The
growth continued. In 1831 agents were sent to Canada and
Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island, in 1850 to South Australia, in 1855 to
Victoria, in 1866 to Queensland, in 1877 to New Zealand and in
1885 to China, so that the original O&rsquo;Bryan tradition of fervid
evangelism was amply maintained.</p>

<p>On O&rsquo;Bryan&rsquo;s departure, James Thorne, the first fully recognized
minister, at whose father&rsquo;s farm the connexion started,
became its leader. Although reared as an ordinary farm lad, he
proved to be a man of singular devotion and spiritual genius.
He laid the foundations broadly in evangelism, finance, temperance
and education, founding in the latter connexion a middle-class
school at Shebbear, at which generations of ministers&rsquo; sons
and numerous students for the ministry have been educated.
James Thorne was five times president of the conference and
fifteen times secretary. He died in 1872. In this period there
was much persecution. Landowners refused sites, and in the
Isle of Wight the people worshipped for many months in a
quarry. The preachers were sometimes imprisoned and many
times assaulted. The old Methodist body even excommunicated
persons for attending &ldquo;Bryanite&rdquo; meetings. Partly co-operative
with James Thorne and at his death independently, the Church
was favoured with the influence of Frederick William Bourne.
He was a minister for fifty-five years, and served the Bible
Christians as editor, missionary treasurer, book steward and
three times president of conference. With him will always be
associated the name of Billy Bray, an illiterate but inimitable
Cornish evangelist, a memoir of whom, written by Bourne,
exerted a great influence in the religious life of the denomination.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In doctrine the Bible Christians did not differ from the other
Methodists. In constitution they differed only slightly. There was
an annual conference with full legislative power, and ability to hold
and dispose of property, composed of an equal number of lay and
ministerial representatives meeting together. The local churches
were grouped into circuits governed representatively by a quarterly
meeting. The quarterly or circuit meetings were in turn organized
into twelve districts, eleven in England and one in China. In 1906
the statistics showed 218 ministers, 32,549 members and 652 chapels,
with 47,301 scholars in Sunday-schools. These figures include
nearly 1400 full and probationary members in the China mission,
the first-fruits of two years&rsquo; labour amongst the Miao tribe. In the
various colonial Methodist unions the Bible Christians have
contributed a total of 159 ministers, 14,925 members and 660 chapels.</p>

<p>The community supported a regular ministry from the beginning.
Its members have been keen evangelists, trusting largely to
&ldquo;revivals&rdquo; for their success, staunch Radicals in politics and total
abstainers to a man. Both ministers and people entered with
interest and sympathy into the scheme for union between themselves,
the Methodist New Connexion and the United Methodist Free Church,
which was successfully accomplished in 1906. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Methodism</a></span>.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIBLE SOCIETIES,<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> associations for translating and circulating
the Holy Scriptures. This object has engaged the attention of
the leaders of Christendom from early times. In an extant
letter, dated <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 331, the emperor Constantine requested
Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, to provide him with fifty copies of
the Old and New Testaments for use in the principal churches in
Constantinople. In 797 Charlemagne commissioned Alcuin to
prepare an emended text of the Vulgate; copies of this text were
multiplied, not always accurately, in the famous writing-schools
at Tours. The first book printed in Europe was the Latin
Bible, and Copinger estimates that 124 editions of the Vulgate
had been issued by the end of the 15th century. The Italian
Bible was printed a dozen times before <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1500, and eighteen
editions of the German Bible had already been published before
Luther&rsquo;s version appeared.</p>

<p>The Reformation quickened men&rsquo;s interest in the Scriptures
to an extraordinary degree, so that, notwithstanding the adverse
attitude adopted by the Roman Church at and after the council
of Trent, the translation and circulation of the Bible were taken
in hand with fresh zeal, and continued in more systematic
fashion.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Thus, the Revised French Geneva Bible of 1588, which was issued
in folio, quarto and octavo, and became a standard text, bears the
following note on the verso of the title: &ldquo;<i>Les frais de cet ouvrage,
imprimé en trois diuerses formes en mesme temps, pour la commodité
et contentement de toutes sortes de personnes, ont esté liberalemet fournis
par quelques gens de bien, qui n&rsquo;ont cherché gagner pour leur particulier,
mais seulement de servir à Dieu et à son Église.</i>&rdquo; The Corporation
for the Promoting and Propagating of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in
New England (founded in 1649) bore the expense of printing both
the New Testament and the Bible as a whole (Cambridge, Mass.,
1663&mdash;the earliest Bible printed in America), which John Eliot, one
of the Pilgrim Fathers, translated into &ldquo;the language of the
Massachusetts Indians,&rdquo; whom he evangelized. In Arnauld&rsquo;s <i>Defence</i>
(1669) of the famous Port Royal version of the New Testament in
French (issued, 1667), he states that it had been printed in many
forms and sizes, including very cheap editions for the poor, and
goes on to describe how its circulation was promoted by &ldquo;<i>les sacrifices
que s&rsquo;imposaient les pieux solitaires pour faire participer les plus
indigents au bienfait de leur entreprise. Dès que leur traduction fut
prête, ils envoyèrent de Paris un grand nombre de colporteurs chargés
de la vendre au prix de revient et même, dans certaines circonstances,
à des prix réduits; et ils couvrirent la dépense par des dons
volontaires</i>&rdquo; (E. Pétavel, <i>La Bible en France</i>, p. 152).</p>

<p>To meet the cost of publishing the Finn Bible in 1685, the editor,
J. Gezelius, bishop of Åbo, obtained an order from the Swedish
government for the appropriation of certain corn-tithes, still known
as <i>Bibel Tryck-Tunnan</i>. When the Finnish Bible Society began
to publish editions of the Scriptures, the tsar Alexander I. contributed
5000 roubles from his privy purse, and ordered that these corn-tithes
should again be appropriated to this purpose for five years
from 1812. In 1701 at Frankfort-On-Main there appeared a quarto
edition of the Ethiopic Psalter, whose editor, H. Ludolf, writes in
his preface: &ldquo;<i>Quamobrem nullum gratius officium Christianae huic
nationi a me praestari posse putavi, quam si Psalterium Aethiopicum,
quod apud illos non aliter quam in membrana manuscriptum habetur,
et caro satis venditur, typis mandari, ejusque plurima exemplaria
nomine Societatis Indicae in Habessinia gratis distribui curarem.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1719 appeared the first of numerous editions of the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page906" id="page906"></a>906</span>
New Testament, connected with the name of the Abbé de Barneville,
a priest of the Oratory at Paris. Impressed by the popular
ignorance of the Scriptures, he himself translated, or caused others
to translate, the New Testament into French from the Vulgate, and
formed an association to distribute copies systematically at low
prices. The prefaces to his various editions contain details as to the
methods of this association, and repeatedly insist on the importance
of reading the Scriptures. (On this <i>Société biblique catholique
française</i> see O. Douen, <i>Histoire de la société biblique
protestante de Paris</i>, Paris, 1868, pp. 46-51.)</p>
</div>

<p>Christian missionaries to non-Christian lands have naturally
been among the most skilful translators and the most assiduous
distributors of the Bible. The earliest complete Arabic Bible
was produced at Rome in 1671, by the <i>Congregatio de Propaganda
Fide</i>. Protestant missionary societies have engaged energetically
in the task not only of translating, but of printing, publishing
and distributing the Scriptures. Thus the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge (founded 1698), besides its other activities,
has done much to cheapen and multiply copies of the Scriptures,
not only in English and Welsh, but in many foreign languages.
Early in the 18th century it printed editions in Arabic, and
promoted the first versions of the Bible in Tamil and Telugu,
made by the Danish Lutheran missionaries whom it then supported
in south India. The earliest New Testament (1767) and
Old Testament (1783-1801) in Gaelic were published by the
Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge
(founded 1709). The S.P.C.K. now publishes versions of the
Scriptures (either complete, or in part) in 38 different languages
(without reckoning versions of the Prayer Book in 45 other
languages); and during 1905-1906 the S.P.C.K. issued in England
116,126 Bibles and 17,783 New Testaments.</p>

<p>The earliest noteworthy organization, formed for the specific
purpose of circulating the Scriptures, was the Canstein Bible
Institute (<i>Bibelanstalt</i>), founded in 1710 at Halle in Saxony, by
Karl Hildebrand, baron von Canstein (1667-1719), who was
associated with P.J. Spener and other leaders of Pietism in
Germany. He invented a method of printing, perhaps somewhat
akin to stereotyping&mdash;though the details are not clearly
known,&mdash;whereby the Institute could produce Bibles and Testaments in
Luther&rsquo;s version at a very low cost, and sell them, in small size,
at prices equivalent to 10d. and 3d. per copy, respectively. In
1722 editions of the Scriptures were also issued in Bohemian and
Polish. At von Canstein&rsquo;s death he left the Institute to the
care of his friend August Hermann Francke, founder in 1698 of
the famous <i>Waisenhaus</i> (orphanage) at Halle. The Canstein
Institute has issued some 6,000,000 copies of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>In England various Christian organizations, which arose out
of the Evangelical movement in the 18th century, took part in
the work. Among such may be mentioned the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge among the Poor (1750); and
the Society for the Support and Encouragement of Sunday
Schools (1785). An institution was founded in 1780 under the
name of the Bible Society, but as its sphere was restricted to
soldiers and seamen the title was afterwards changed to the
Naval and Military Bible Society. The first ship among whose
crew it distributed the Scriptures was the &ldquo;Royal George,&rdquo;
which had 400 of this society&rsquo;s Bibles on board when it foundered
at Spithead on the 29th of August 1782. The French Bible
Society, instituted in 1792, came to an end in 1803, owing to the
Revolution.</p>

<p><i>The British and Foreign Bible Society.</i>&mdash;In 1804 was founded
in London the British and Foreign Bible Society, the most
important association of its kind. It originated in a proposal
made to the committee of the Religious Tract Society, by the
Rev. Thomas Charles of Bala, who found that his evangelistic
and philanthropic labours in Wales were sorely hindered by
the dearth of Welsh Bibles. His colleagues in the Religious
Tract Society united with other earnest evangelical leaders to
establish a new society, which should have for its sole object
&ldquo;to encourage a wider circulation of the Holy Scriptures, without
note or comment.&rdquo; This simplicity of aim is combined with a
catholicity of constitution which admits the co-operation of all
persons interested in the society&rsquo;s object. The committee of
management consists of thirty-six laymen, six of them being
foreigners resident in or near London, while of the remaining
thirty, half are members of the Church of England, and half
are members of other Christian denominations.</p>

<p>Supported by representative Christian leaders, such as Granville
Sharp, Zachary Macaulay, William Wilberforce, Charles
Grant and Henry Thornton, with Lord Teignmouth, ex-governor-general
of India, as its first president, and Dr Porteus, bishop of
London, as its friendly counsellor, the new society made rapid
progress. It spread throughout Great Britain, mainly by means
of auxiliaries, <i>i.e.</i> local societies, affiliated but self-controlled,
with subsidiary branches and associations (these last being often
managed by women). Up to 1816-1817 the parent society
had received from its auxiliaries altogether £420,000. This
system continues to flourish. In 1905-1906 the society had
about 5800 auxiliaries, branches and associations in England
and Wales, and more than 2000 auxiliaries abroad, mainly
in the British Colonies, many of which undertake vigorous
local work, besides remitting contributions to London.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The society&rsquo;s advance was chequered by several controversies.
(<i>a</i>) Its fundamental law to circulate the Bible alone, without note
or comment, was vehemently attacked by Bishop Marsh and other
divines of the Church of England, who insisted that the Prayer
Book ought to accompany the Bible. (<i>b</i>) Another more serious
controversy related to the circulation&mdash;chiefly through affiliated
societies on the continent&mdash;of Bibles containing the Deutero-canonical
books of the Old Testament. In 1826 the society finally resolved
that its fundamental law be fully and distinctly recognized as
excluding the circulation &ldquo;of those Books, or parts of Books, which are
usually termed Apocryphal.&rdquo; This step, however, failed to satisfy
most of the society&rsquo;s supporters in Scotland, who proceeded to form
themselves into independent organizations, grouped for the most
part round centres at Edinburgh and Glasgow. These were finally
amalgamated in 1861 into the National Bible Society of Scotland.
(<i>c</i>) A third dispute turned upon the admissibility of non-Trinitarians
to the privilege of co-operation. The refusal of the society to alter
its constitution so as formally to exclude such persons led to the
formation (1831) of the Trinitarian Bible Society, which is still in
existence. (<i>d</i>) A fourth controversy arose out of the restrictive
renderings of the term &ldquo;baptize&rdquo; and its cognate terms, adopted
by William Carey and his colleagues in their famous &ldquo;Serampore
Versions,&rdquo; towards publishing which the society had contributed
up to 1830 nearly £30,000. Protests from other Indian missionaries
led the society to determine that it could circulate only such versions
as gave neutral renderings for the terms in question. As a sequel, the
Bible Translation Society was founded in 1839 to issue versions
embodying distinctively Baptist renderings.</p>

<p>By one of its original laws the British and Foreign Bible Society
could circulate no copies of the Scriptures in English other than
King James&rsquo;s Version of 1611. In 1901 this law was widened to
include the Revised English Version of 1881-1885.</p>

<p>From its foundation the society has successfully laboured to
promote new and improved versions of the Scriptures. In 1804 the
Bible, or some part of it, had been printed in about fifty-five different
tongues. By the year 1906 versions, more or less complete, had
been published in more than 530 distinct languages and dialects,
and in 400 of these the work of translation, printing or distribution
had been promoted by the society. Translations or revisions in
scores of languages are still being carried on by companies of scholars
and representative missionaries in different parts of the world,
organized under the society&rsquo;s auspices and largely at its expense.
New versions are made, wherever practicable, from the original
Hebrew or Greek text, and the results thus obtained have a high
philological value and interest. The society&rsquo;s interdenominational
character has commonly secured&mdash;what could hardly otherwise
have been attained&mdash;the acceptance of the same version by missions
of different churches working side by side. The society supplies
the Scriptures to missions of every Reformed Communion on such
terms that, as a rule, the books distributed by the missions involve
no charge on their funds. Except under special circumstances, the
society does not encourage wholesale free distribution, but provides
cheap editions at prices which the poorest can pay. On the whole
it receives from sales about 40% of what it expends in preparing,
printing and circulating the books.</p>

<p>During the year 1905-1906 the society&rsquo;s circulation reached the
unprecedented total of 5,977,453 copies, including 968,683 Bibles
and 1,326,475 Testaments. Of the whole 1,921,000 volumes were
issued from the Bible House, London, and 1,331,000 were in English
or Welsh, circulating chiefly in England and the British colonies.
The other main fields of distribution were as follows:&mdash;France,
203,000 copies; Central Europe, 679,000; Italy, 117,000; Spain
and Portugal, 120,000; the Russian empire, 595,000; India,
Burma and Ceylon, 768,000; Japan, 286,000; and China, 1,075,000
(most of these last being separate gospels).</p>

<p>The society spends £10,000 a year in grants to religious and
philanthropic agencies at home. Outside the United Kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page907" id="page907"></a>907</span>
it has its own agencies or secretaries in twenty-seven of the chief
cities of the world, and maintains depots in 200 other centres. It
employs 930 Christian colporteurs abroad, who sold in 1905-1906
over 2,250,000 volumes. It supports 670 native Christian Bible-women
in the East, in connexion with forty different missionary
organizations. The centenary festival in 1904 was celebrated with
enthusiasm by the Reformed Churches and their foreign missions
throughout the world. Messages of congratulation came from the
rulers of every Protestant nation in Christendom, and a centenary
thanksgiving fund of 250,000 guineas was raised for extending the
society&rsquo;s work. During the year 1905-1906 the society expended
£238,632, while its income was £231,964 (of which £98,204 represented
receipts from sales). Up to the 31st of March 1906 the society had
expended altogether £14,686,072, and had issued 198,515,199 copies
of the Scriptures&mdash;of which more than 78,000,000 were in English.</p>
</div>

<p><i>In Scotland</i> the Edinburgh Bible Society (1809), the Glasgow
Bible Society (1812), and other Scottish auxiliaries, many
of which had dissociated themselves from the British and
Foreign Bible Society after 1826, were finally incorporated (1861)
with the National Bible Society of Scotland, which has carried
on vigorous work all over the world, especially in China. During
1905, with an income of £27,108, it issued 1,590,881 copies,
907,000 of which were circulated in China. Its total issues from
1861 to 1906 were 26,106,265 volumes.</p>

<p><i>In Ireland</i> the Hibernian Bible Society (originally known as
the Dublin Bible Society) was founded in 1806, and with it were
federated kindred Irish associations formed at Cork, Belfast,
Derry, &amp;c. The Hibernian Bible Society, whose centenary was
celebrated in 1906, had then issued a total of 5,713,837 copies.
It sends an annual subsidy to aid the foreign work of the British
and Foreign Bible Society.</p>

<p><i>Other European Societies.</i>&mdash;The impulse which founded the
British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804 soon spread over
Europe, and, notwithstanding the turmoils of the Napoleonic
wars, kindred organizations on similar lines quickly sprang up,
promoted and subsidized by the British and Foreign Bible
Society. Many of these secured royal and aristocratic patronage
and encouragement&mdash;the tsar of Russia, the kings of Prussia,
Bavaria, Sweden, Denmark and Württemberg all lending their
influence to the enterprise.</p>

<p>Within fourteen years the following Bible societies were in
active operation: the Basel Bible Society (founded at Nuremberg,
1804), the Prussian Bible Society (founded as the Berlin Bible
Society, 1805), the Revel Bible Society (1807), the Swedish
Evangelical Society (1808), the Dorpat Bible Society (1811),
the Riga Bible Society (1812), the Finnish Bible Society (1812),
the Hungarian Bible Institution (Pressburg, 1812), the Württemberg
Bible Society (Stuttgart, 1812), the Swedish Bible
Society (1814), the Danish Bible Society (1814), the Saxon Bible
Society (Dresden, 1814), the Thuringian Bible Society (Erfurt,
1814), the Berg Bible Society (Eberfeld, 1814), the Hanover
Bible Society (1814), the Hamburg-Altona Bible Society (1814),
the Lübeck Bible Society (1814), the Netherlands Bible Society
(Amsterdam, 1814). These were increased in 1815 by the
Brunswick, Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein, Strassburg and Eichsfeld
(Saxony) Bible Societies, and the Icelandic Bible Society.
In 1816-1817 came the Norwegian Bible Society, the Polish
Bible Society and ten minor German Bible Societies. Twelve
cantonal societies had also been formed in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Up to 1816-1817 these societies had printed altogether
436,000 copies of the Scriptures, and had received from the
British and Foreign Bible Society gifts amounting to over
£62,000. The decision of the British and Foreign Bible Society
in 1826 with regard to circulating the Apocrypha (see above)
modified its relations with the most influential of these continental
societies. Some of them were ultimately dissolved or suppressed
through political or ecclesiastical opposition, the Roman Church
proving especially hostile. But many of them still flourish,
and are actively engaged in their original task.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The circulation of the Scriptures by German Bible Societies
during 1905 was estimated as follows:&mdash;The Prussian Bible Society
(Berlin), 182,000 copies; the Württemberg Bible Institute (Stuttgart),
247,000; the Berg Bible Society (Eberfeld), 142,000; the
Saxon Bible Society (Dresden), 44,000; the Central Bible Association
(Nuremberg), 14,000; the Canstein Bible Institute (Halle), the
Schleswig-Holstein Bible Society, the Hamburg-Altona Bible Society
and others, together 56,000.</p>

<p>During 1905, nine cantonal Bible societies in Switzerland circulated
altogether 71,000 copies; the Netherlands Bible Society
reported a circulation of 54,544 volumes, 48,137 of which were in
Dutch; the Danish Bible Society circulated 45,289 copies; the
Norwegian Bible Society circulated 67,058 copies; and in Sweden
the Evangelical National Society distributed about 110,000 copies.</p>

<p>In Italy, by a departure from the traditional policy of the Roman
Church, the newly formed &ldquo;Pious Society of St Jerome for the
Dissemination of the Holy Gospels&rdquo; issued in 1901 from the Vatican
press a new Italian version of the Four Gospels and <i>Acts</i>. By the
end of 1905 the society announced that over 400,000 copies of this
volume had been sold at 2d. a copy.</p>

<p>In France, the <i>Société biblique protestante de Paris</i>, founded in
1818, with generous aid from the British and Foreign Bible Society,
had a somewhat restricted basis and scope. In 1833 the <i>Société
biblique française et étrangère</i> was formed on wider lines; after its
dissolution in 1863, many of its supporters joined the <i>Société biblique
de France</i>, which dates from 1864, and represents chiefly members
of the <i>Église libre</i>, and kindred French Evangelicals. During 1905
its issues were 34,475 copies, while the <i>Société biblique protestante de
Paris</i> issued 8061 copies.</p>

<p>Of these non-British societies the most noteworthy was established
in Russia. In December 1812, while &ldquo;the last shattered remnants
of Napoleon&rsquo;s Grand Army struggled across the ice of the Niemen,&rdquo;
the tsar Alexander I. sanctioned plans for a Bible society, which
was promptly inaugurated at St Petersburg under the presidency
of Prince Galitzin. Through the personal favour of the tsar, it made
rapid and remarkable progress. Nobles and ministers of state, with
the chief ecclesiastics not only of the Russian Church but of the
Roman, the Uniat, the Armenian, the Greek, the Georgian and the
Lutheran Churches, found themselves constrained to serve on its
committees. By the close of 1823 the Russian Bible Society had
formed 289 auxiliaries, extending eastwards to Yakutsk and
Okhotsk; and had received altogether £145,640. In 1824, however,
Prince Galitzin ceased to be procurator of the Holy Synod, and
Seraphim, metropolitan of St Petersburg, became president of the
Russian Bible Society. And in 1826, soon after his accession, the
tsar Nicholas I. issued a <i>ukase</i> suspending the society&rsquo;s operations&mdash;after
it had printed the Scriptures in thirty different languages,
seventeen of which were new tongues, and had circulated 600,000
volumes from the Caucasus to Kamchatka. In 1828 Nicholas I.
sanctioned the establishment of a Protestant Bible Society, which
still exists, to supply the Scriptures only to Protestant subjects of
the tsar (cf. Th. Schiemann, <i>Geschichte Russlands unter Nikolaus I.</i>
vol. i. chap. ix.). In 1839 St Petersburg became the headquarters
of an agency of the British and Foreign Bible Society, which enjoys
special facilities in Russia, and now annually circulates about
600,000 copies of the Scriptures, in fifty different languages, within
the Russian empire.</p>
</div>

<p><i>In America</i> the earliest Bible society was founded at Philadelphia
in 1808. Six more societies&mdash;including those of New York
and of Massachusetts&mdash;were formed during 1809, and other
societies, auxiliaries and associations quickly followed. In
1816 a convention of delegates representing 31 of these institutions
met at New York and established the American Bible Society,
with Elias Boudinot as president. All kindred organizations in
the states gradually became amalgamated with this national body,
and the federation was completed in 1839 by the adhesion of the
Philadelphia Society (which now changed its name to the Pennsylvania
Bible Society). Not a few noteworthy versions of the Bible,
such as those in Arabic, 15 dialects of Chinese, Armenian, and
Zulu, and many American Indian, Philippine, and African languages
have appeared under the auspices of the American Bible
Society. Turkish, classical Chinese, and Korean versions have
been made by the American and British societies jointly. The
society&rsquo;s foreign agencies extend to China, Japan, Korea, the
Turkish empire, Bulgaria, Egypt, Micronesia, Siam, Mexico, Central
America, the South American republics, Cuba and the Philippines.
In the year ending March 31st 1909 the income of the
Society was $502,345, and it issued 2,153,028 copies of the Scriptures,
nearly half of which went to readers outside the United States.
The total distribution effected by the American Bible Society and
its federated societies had in 1909 exceeded 84,000,000 volumes, in
over a hundred different languages.</p>

was used in post-classical Greek for the writing of books, and as
late as 1761, in Fenning&rsquo;s <i>English Dictionary</i>, a bibliographer
is defined as &ldquo;one who writes or copies books.&rdquo; The transition
from the meaning &ldquo;a writing <i>of</i> books&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;a writing
<i>about</i> books,&rdquo; was accomplished in France in the 18th
century&mdash;witness the publication in 1763 of the <i>Bibliographie instructive</i>
of de Bure. In England the new meaning seems to have been
popularized by the Rev. Thomas Frognall Dibdin early in the
19th century, while Southey preferred the rival form <i>bibliology</i>,
which is now hardly used. Present custom inclines to restrict
the province of bibliography to printed books as opposed to
manuscripts, and on the other hand recognizes as coming within
its scope almost everything in which a book-loving antiquary
can be interested, including the history of printing (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Typography</a></span>), book-binding (<i>q.v.</i>), book-illustration (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Illustration</a></span>)
and book-collecting (<i>q.v.</i>). The present article is only
concerned with bibliography as the art of the examination,
collation and description of books, their enumeration and
arrangement in lists for purposes of information, and further
with the literature of this subject, <i>i.e.</i> with the bibliography
of bibliography.</p>

<p><i>Examination and Collation.</i>&mdash;Books are submitted to examination
in order to discover their origin, or to test statements concerning
it which there is reason to doubt, or to ascertain if they
are perfect, and if perfect whether they are in their original
condition or have been &ldquo;made up&rdquo; from other copies. The
discovery of where, when and by whom a book, or fragment
of a book, was printed, is the most difficult of these tasks, though
as regards books printed in the 15th century it has been much
facilitated by the numerous facsimiles enumerated under
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Incunabula</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>). In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Book</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>) a sketch is given
of the chief external characteristics of books in each century
since the invention of printing. Familiarity with books of
different ages and countries soon creates a series of general
ideas as to the dates and places with which any combination of
these characteristics may be connected, and an experienced
bibliographer, more especially if he knows something of the
history of paper, will quickly narrow down the field of inquiry
sufficiently to make special search possible.</p>

<p>As regards the correction of mis-statements in early books
as to their place and origin, glaring piracies such as the Lyonnese
counterfeits of the octavo editions of the classics printed by
Aldus at Venice, and the numerous unauthorized editions of
works by Luther, professing to be printed at Wittenberg, have
long ago been exposed. A different variety of the same kind
of puzzle arises from the existence of numerous original
editions with fictitious imprints. As early as 1499 a Brescia
printer, in order to evade the privilege granted to Aldus, gave
to an edition of Politian the spurious imprint &ldquo;Florentiae,&rdquo;
and in the 16th century many controversial books printed in
England purported to have been issued in German towns, or
with pleasant humour, &ldquo;at Rome before the castle of S. Angel
at the sign of S. Peter.&rdquo; Only a knowledge of the general
characteristics which a book printed at such a place and such
a time should possess will secure avoidance of these traps, but
when suspicion has been aroused the whole story will often be
found in such books as Weller&rsquo;s <i>Die maskirte Literatur der älteren
und neueren Sprachen</i> (1856-1867), and <i>Die falschen und fingirten
Druckörte</i> (1864), Brunet&rsquo;s <i>Imprimeurs imaginaires et libraires
supposés</i> (1866), de Brouillant&rsquo;s <i>La Liberté de la Presse en France;
Histoire de Pierre du Marteau, imprimeur à Cologne, &amp;c.</i> (1888);
in the various bibliographies of Erotica and in Brunet&rsquo;s <i>Manuel
de l&rsquo;Amateur</i> and other handbooks for the use of collectors.
A special case of this problem of piracies and spurious imprints
is that of the modern photographic or type-facsimile forgery
of small books possessing a high commercial value, such as the
early editions of the letter of Columbus announcing his discovery
of the New World. Bad forgeries of this kind can be detected
by the tendency of all photographic processes of reproduction
to thicken letters and exaggerate every kind of defect, but the
best of these imitations when printed on old paper require
a specific knowledge of the originals and often cause great
trouble. The type-facsimile forgeries are mostly of short pieces
by Tennyson, George Eliot and A.C. Swinburne, printed (or
supposed to have been printed&mdash;for it is doubtful if some of
these &ldquo;forgeries&rdquo; ever had any originals) for circulation among
friends. These trifles should never be purchased without a
written guarantee.</p>

<p>When the edition to which a book belongs is known, further
examination is needed to ascertain if it is perfect and in its
original state. Where no standard collation is available, this
can only be ascertained by a detailed examination of the quires
or gatherings of which it is made up (see below). In the earliest
books these are often very irregular. A large book was usually
printed simultaneously in four or six sections on as many different
presses, and the several compositors, if unable to end their
sections at the end of a complete quire, would insert a single
leaf to give more space, or sometimes leave a blank page, or
half page, for lack of matter, occasionally adding the note &ldquo;<i>Hic
nullus est defectus.</i>&rdquo; A careful examination of the text, a task
from which bibliographers often shrink, and a comparison with
other editions, are the only remedies in these cases.</p>

<p>If a copy contains the right number of leaves, the further
question arises as to whether any of these have been supplied
from other copies, or are in facsimile. Few collectors even now
are educated enough to prefer copies in the condition in which
the ravages of time have left them to those which have been
&ldquo;completed&rdquo; by dealers; hence many old books have been
&ldquo;made up&rdquo; with leaves from other copies, or not infrequently
from other editions. These meddlings often defy detection,
but proof of them may be found in differences in the height and
colour of the paper, in the two corresponding leaves at either
end of a folio quire both possessing a watermark, or in their
wiremarks not corresponding, or (in very early books) by the
ornamentation added by hand being in a different style.</p>

<p>When it has been ascertained that a copy contains the right
number of leaves and that all these leaves are original, the last
point to be settled is as to whether it differs in any respect from
the standard collation. Owing to the extreme slowness of the
presswork for the first two centuries after the invention of
printing, there were more opportunities for making small corrections
while an old book was passing through the press than
there are in the case of modern ones, and on the other hand the
balls used for inking the type sometimes caught up words or
individual letters and these were replaced by the compositors
as best they could. The small variations in the text noticed
in different copies of the First Folio edition of Shakespeare, and
again of Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i>, are probably to be explained
by a mixture of these two causes. Where a serious error was
discovered after a sheet had been printed off, the leaf on which
it occurred was sometimes cut out and a new leaf (called a
&ldquo;cancel&rdquo;) printed to replace it and pasted on to the rest of
the sheet. Variations between different copies of the first edition
of Herrick&rsquo;s <i>Hesperides</i> which have puzzled all his editors are
due to the presence of several of such cancels. Lastly, a printer
when he had printed part of a book might wish to increase the
size of the edition, and the leaves already printed off would have
to be reprinted, thus causing a combination of identical and
different leaves in different copies. The famous 42-line Bible
of <i>c.</i> 1455, variously attributed to Gutenberg and to Fust and
Schoeffer, and the <i>Valerius Maximus</i> printed by Schoeffer in
1471, are instances of editions being thus enlarged while passing
through the press. As each book was set up simultaneously on
several different presses, the reprinted leaves occur at the
beginning of each of the sections.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that there are books of which it is
difficult to find two copies in exact agreement. Either to
quicken presswork or to comply with trade-regulations made
in the interest of compositors, in some books of which large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page909" id="page909"></a>909</span>
numbers were required, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Paraphrases of Erasmus</i>, the
<i>First Prayer-book of Edward VI.</i>, and the &ldquo;Songs and Sonnets&rdquo;
known as <i>Tottell&rsquo;s Miscellany</i>, each forme was set up two or
more different times. The formes were then used at haphazard
for printing, and both at this stage and when the printed sheets
came to be stitched almost any number of different combinations
might be made. The books named were all printed in the
middle of the 16th century, but probably later instances could
be produced.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The ideal towards which all bibliographical
work should be directed is the provision in an accessible form of
a standard description of a perfect copy of every book of literary,
historical or typographical interest as it first issued from the
press, and of all the variant issues and editions of it. When such
standard descriptions shall have been made, adequately checked
and printed, it will be possible to describe every individual copy
by a simple reference to them, with a statement of its differences,
if any, and an insistence on the points bearing on the special
object with which it is being re-described. Only in a few cases
has any approach been made to a collection of such standard
descriptions. One instance which may be cited is that of the
entries of the 15th century books in the <i>Repertorium
Bibliographicum</i> of Ludwig Hain (1826-1838), which the addition of
an asterisk marks as having been examined by Hain himself in
the copies in the Royal library at Munich. The high standard
of accuracy of these asterisked entries (save for the omission to
note blank leaves at the beginning or end) has been so well
established, and the <i>Repertorium</i> is so widely known, that in
many catalogues of incunabula the short title of the book
together with the number of Hain&rsquo;s entry has been usefully
substituted for a long description. Books printed at Oxford up
to 1640 can be equally well described by their short titles and a
reference to Mr Falconer Madan&rsquo;s <i>Early Oxford Press</i> published
in 1895. At present the number of works which can thus be
taken as a standard is only small, owing partly to the greater
and more accurate detail now demanded, partly to the absence
of any system of co-operation among libraries, each of which is
only willing to pay for catalogues relating exclusively to its own
collections. It may be hoped that through the foundation of
bibliographical institutes more work of this kind may be done.</p>

<p>A standard description of any book must, as a rule, consist of
the following sections, though in the case of works which have no
typographical interest, some of the details may be advantageously
omitted:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) A literal transcript of the title-page, also of
the colophon, if any, and of any headings or other portions of the
book serving to distinguish it from other issues; (<i>b</i>) Statements
as to the size or form of the book, the gatherings or quires of
which it is made up, with the total number of leaves, the measurement
of an uncut copy or of the type-page, a note of the types in
which different parts of the book are printed, and a reference
to any trustworthy information already in print; (<i>c</i>) A statement
of the literary contents of the book and of the points at
which they respectively begin; (<i>d</i>) A note giving any additional
information which may be needed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(<i>a</i>) In transcribing the title-page and other parts of the book
it is desirable not to omit intermediate words; if an omission is
made it should be indicated by three dots placed close together.
The end of a line should be indicated by an upright stroke.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> It is
a considerable gain to indicate to the eye in what types the words
transcribed are printed, <i>i.e.</i> whether in roman, gothic letter, or
italic, and in each case whether in majuscules or minuscules (&ldquo;upper
or lower case&rdquo;). To do this, however, adds greatly not only to the
cost of printing, but also to the liability of error. If roman minuscules
are used throughout, or roman for the text and italic for the
imprint of colophon, the method of transliteration which the printer
himself would have used should be adopted. Many of the best
modern catalogues and bibliographies are disfigured by the occurrence
in them of such forms as &ldquo;qvinqve,&rdquo; &ldquo;qveen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evrope,&rdquo;
due to an unintelligent transliteration of the forms QVINQVE,
QVEEN, EVROPE, as they occur on title-pages at a date when
&ldquo;V&rdquo; was the majuscule form of both &ldquo;v&rdquo; and &ldquo;u.&rdquo; If it is desired
to retain the V forms the words should be printed in majuscules.
If minuscules are used, the words should be transliterated
as quinque, queen, Europe, according to the practice of the old
printers themselves.</p>

<p>A troublesome question often arises as to what notice should be
taken in reproducing the misprints which frequently occur in the
original titles. Bibliographers who have satisfied themselves (and
their readers) of their own accuracy may reproduce them in silence,
though it will need constant watchfulness to prevent the printer
from &ldquo;setting them right.&rdquo; Transcribers of only average accuracy
will consult their happiness by indicating the misprint in some way,
and the frequent use of (<i>sic</i>), more especially when printed in italics,
or of the German (!), being ugly, probably the simplest plan is to add
a note at the end stating that the misprints in question occur in the
original.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The &ldquo;size&rdquo; of a book is a technical expression for the relation
of the individual leaves to the sheet of paper of which they form a
part. A book in-folio means one in which the paper has been folded
once, so that each sheet has made two leaves. In a book in-quarto,
each sheet has been folded twice so as to make four leaves. In an
octavo another fold has produced eight leaves, and so on for books in
16mo, 32mo and 64mo. For books in twelves, twenty-fours, &amp;c., the
paper has at some stage to be folded in three instead of in two, and
there will be some difference in form according to the way in which
this is done. The size of a book printed on handmade paper &ldquo;is very
simply recognized by holding up a page to the light. Certain white
lines, called wire-lines, will be noticed, occurring as a rule about an
inch apart, and running at right angles to the fine lines. These
wire-lines are perpendicular in a folio, octavo, 32mo, and horizontal
in a quarto and 16mo. In a 12mo, as the name implies, the sheet is
folded in twelve; and in the earlier part at least of the 16th century
this was done in such a way that the wire-lines are perpendicular,
the height of the sheet forming two pages, as is the case in an octavo,
while the width is divided into six instead of into four as in an
octavo. The later habit has been to fold the sheet differently, the
height of the sheet forming the width of four pages, and the width
of the sheet the height of three pages, consequently the wire-lines
are horizontal&rdquo; (E.G. Duff, <i>Early Printed Books</i>, pp. 206-207).</p>

<p>The recognition of what is meant by the size of a book has been
obscured by the erroneous idea that the quires or gatherings of which
books are made up necessarily consist of single sheets.<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> If this were
so all folios would be in gatherings of two leaves each; all quartos
in gatherings of four leaves; all octavos in gatherings of eights.
In the case of books printed on handmade paper, this is generally
true of octavos, but to reduce the amount of sewing the earliest
folios were usually arranged in tens, <i>i.e.</i> in gatherings of five sheets
or ten leaves, while in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time English folios were mostly
in sixes. In the same way quartos are often found made up in
eights, and on the other hand the use of a half-sheet produces a
gathering of only two leaves.</p>

<p>When a manuscript or early printed book was being prepared for
binding, it was usual for the order in which the quires or gatherings
were to be arranged to be indicated by signing them with the letters
of the alphabet in their order, the alphabet generally used being
the Latin, in which I stands for both I and J; V for both U and V,
and there is no W. If more than twenty-three letters were needed
the contractions for <i>et</i>, <i>con</i>, <i>rum</i> and (less often) that for <i>us</i>, were
used as additional signs, and for large books minuscules were used
as well as majuscules, and the letters were doubled. In 1472 printed
signatures came into use. If the quires or gatherings in the book
to be described are signed in print, the signatures used should be
quoted without brackets. If they are not signed, the order of the
gatherings should be noted by the letters of the alphabet in square
brackets. In each case the number of leaves in each gathering
should be shown by index-figures. Thus, six gatherings of eight
leaves followed by one of four should be represented by the symbols
A-F<span class="sp">8</span> G<span class="sp">4</span>. The &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; of an old book in original binding is
usually sufficiently shown by the strings in the middle of each quire.
In books which have been rebound help may sometimes be obtained
from the fact that between (roughly) 1750 and 1850, a period during
which there was much rebinding of early books, the gatherings
before being put into their new quires were mostly separately
pressed, with the result that the outer pages of each gathering are
much smoother than the rest. But the only safe guide to the make-up
of an old book without printed signatures is a collation by means
of the watermarks, <i>i.e.</i> the devices with which the papermaker as
a rule marked each sheet (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paper</a></span>). In a folio book one of every
pair of leaves should have a watermark in the middle of the paper.
In a quarto some pairs of leaves will have no watermark; in others
it will be found divided by the fold of the paper. As the great
majority of books without printed signatures are in folio or quarto,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page910" id="page910"></a>910</span>
the sequence of watermarked and un-watermarked leaves, if carefully
worked out, will mostly reveal the &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; of the successive
gatherings.</p>

<p>After the size and sequence of the gatherings has been stated, the
total number of leaves should be noted, with a mention of any
numeration of them given in the book. Any discrepancy between
the total of the leaves assigned to the successive gatherings and the
total as separately counted of course points to an error, and the
reckonings must be repeated till they tally. Errors in the printed
enumeration of the leaves of old books are common, and it is seldom
necessary to point them out in detail. When reference has to be
made to a particular page of an old book, the printed signatures
offer the readiest means, an index number placed below the letter
indicating the number of the leaf in the gathering and the addition
of &ldquo;recto&rdquo; or &ldquo;verso&rdquo; marking the upper or under page of the
leaf. Thus &ldquo;X<span class="su">4</span> recto&rdquo; (some bibliographers prefer the rather
clumsier form &ldquo;X 4 recto&rdquo;) stands for the first page of the fourth
leaf of the gathering signed X. Where there are no printed signatures
the leaf-number may be given, the letters &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo;
above the numeral taking the place of &ldquo;recto&rdquo; and &ldquo;verso&rdquo;
(leaf 99<span class="sp">a</span>). Where some leaves of a book are numbered and others
not, if the reference is to the printed numeration this should be stated.
Printed leaf numeration is found as early as 1470, and became
common about ten years later. Printed pagination did not become
common till nearly the middle of the 16th century.</p>

<p>The foregoing details are all directed to showing which leaves of
a book would be printed by the same pull of the press, how it was
made up for binding, and how imperfections in any copy may be
detected. They give little or no indication of the dimensions of the
book. In the case of modern editions this may be done by adding
one of the trade epithets, pott, foolscap, crown, &amp;c., to the name of
the size, which when thus qualified denotes paper of a particular
measurement (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paper</a></span>). As, however, these measurements are
not easily remembered, it is better to give the actual measurements
in inches or millimetres of a page of an uncut copy. In old books
uncut copies are not easily found, and it is useful instead of this to
give the measurement in millimetres of the printed portion of the
page (technically called the &ldquo;type-page&rdquo;), although this is subject
to a variation of about 3% in different copies, according to the
degree to which they were damped for printing. To this is added
a statement of the number of lines in the page measured. The
character of the type (roman, gothic or italic) is next mentioned,
and in the case of 15th-century books, its number in the sequence
of founts used by the printer (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Incunabula</a></span>). Finally a reference
to any authoritative description already printed completes this
portion of the entry. Thus the description of the collation of the
first-dated book printed at Augsburg, the <i>Meditationes</i> of S. Bonaventura,
printed by Günther Zainer in 1468, should read: Folio
(a<span class="sp">10</span>, b-d<span class="sp">8</span>, e-g<span class="sp">10</span>, h<span class="sp">8</span>) 72 leaves. Type-page (<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a>) 202 × 120 mm.; 35 lines.
Type 1 (gothic letter). Hain 3557.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) While many books, and this is especially true of early ones,
contain little or nothing beyond the bare text of a well-known work,
others are well provided, not only with commentaries which are
almost sure to be mentioned on the title-page, or in the colophon
(which the editor himself often wrote), but also with dedicatory
letters, prefaces, complimentary verses, indexes and other accessories,
the presence of which it is desirable to indicate. In these cases it is
often convenient to show the entire contents of the book in the order
in which they occur, noting the leaves or pages on which each begins.
Thus in the first edition (1590) of the first three books of Spenser&rsquo;s
<i>Faerie Queene</i>, the literary contents, their order, and the space
they occupy can be concisely noted by taking the successive gatherings
according to their signatures and showing what comes on each
page. Thus: A<span class="su">1</span>, recto, title; verso, dedication, &ldquo;To the Most
Mightie and Magnificent Empresse Elizabeth&rdquo;; A<span class="su">2</span>-Oo<span class="su">8</span>, text of
books i.-iii.; Pp<span class="su">1</span>, letter dated the 23rd of January 1589 [1590] to
Sir Walter Raleigh expounding the intention of the work; Pp<span class="su">3</span> verso,
commendatory verses signed W. R[aleigh], Hobynoll (Gabriel
Harvey), R.S., H.B., W.L. and Ignoto; Pp<span class="su">5-8</span>, complimentary
sonnets severally inscribed to Sir C. Hatton, the earls of Essex,
Oxford, Northumberland and Ormond, Lord Ch. Howard, Lord
Grey of Wilton and Sir W. Raleigh, and to Lady Carew and to the
Ladies in the Court; and &ldquo;Faults escaped in the print&rdquo;; Qq<span class="su">1-4</span>,
fifteen other sonnets.</p>

<p>Some bibliographers prefer to reverse the order of notation,
(title, A<span class="su">1</span>, recto; dedication, A<span class="su">1</span>, verso, &amp;c.), and no principle is
sacrificed in doing so, though the order suggested usually works out
the more neatly.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Enumeration and Arrangement.</i>&mdash;In the 18th and early 19th
centuries there was a tendency, especially among French writers,
to exaggerate the scope of bibliography, on the ground that it
was the duty of the bibliographer to appraise the value of all the
books he recorded, and to indicate the exact place which each
work should occupy in a logical classification of all literature
based on a previous classification of all knowledge. Bibliographers
are now more modest. They recognize that the
classification of human knowledge is a question for philosophers
and men of science, that the knowledge of chemistry and of its
history needed to make a good bibliography of chemistry is altogether
extrinsic to bibliography itself; that all, in fact, to which
bibliography can pretend is to suggest certain general principles
of arrangement and to point out to some extent how they may
be applied. The principles are neither numerous nor recondite.
To illustrate the history of printing, books may be arranged
according to the places and printing-houses where they were
produced. For the glorification of a province or county, they
are sometimes grouped under the places where their authors
were born or resided. For special purposes, they may be arranged
according to the language or dialect in which they are written.
But, speaking generally, the choice for a basis of arrangement
rests between the alphabetical order of authors and titles, a
chronological order according to date of publication, a &ldquo;logical&rdquo;
or alphabetical order according to subjects, and some combination
of these methods. In exercising the choice the essential
requisite is a really clear idea of the use to which the bibliography,
when made, is to be put. If its chief object be to give detailed
information about individual books, a strictly alphabetical
arrangement &ldquo;by authors and titles&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> by the names of
authors in their alphabetical order, and the titles of their books
in alphabetical sequence under the names) will be the most
useful, because it enables the student to obtain the information
he seeks with the greatest ease. But while such an alphabetical
arrangement offers the speediest access to individual entries, it
has no other merit, unless the main object of the bibliography
be to show what each author has written. If it is desired to
illustrate the history and development of a subject, or the
literary biography of an author, the books should be entered
chronologically. If direction in reading is to be given, this can
best be offered by a subject-index, in which the subjects are
arranged alphabetically for speedy reference, and the books
chronologically under the subject, so that the newest are always
at the end. Lastly if the object is to show how far the whole
field has been covered and what gaps remain to be filled, a class
catalogue arranged according to what are considered the logical
subdivisions of the subject has its advantages. It is important,
however, to remember that, if the bulk of the bibliography is
very large, a principle of arrangement which would be clear and
useful on a small scale may be lost in the quantity of pages over
which it extends. An arrangement which cannot be quickly
grasped, whatever satisfaction it may give its author, is useless
to readers, the measure of its inutility being the worn condition
of the alphabetical index to which those who cannot carry a
complicated &ldquo;logical&rdquo; arrangement in their heads are obliged
to turn, in the first instance, to find what they want. It should
be obvious that any system which necessitates a preliminary
reference to a key or index rests under grave suspicion, and needs
some clear counterbalancing gain to justify the loss of time
which it entails. The main classification should always be that
which will be most immediately useful to readers of the books.
To throw light on the history of a subject and to indicate how
far the field is covered are honourable objects for compilers, but
should mostly be held subordinate to practical use. It is noteworthy
also that they may often be better forwarded by means
of an index or table than by the main arrangement. The history
of Hain&rsquo;s <i>Repertorium Bibliographicum</i>, which enumerates in an
alphabetical arrangement of authors and titles some 16,000 books
printed in the 15th century, is a good example of this. For
sixty-five years it was of the utmost use for its accurate descriptions
of individual books, but threw practically no light on the
history of printing. In 1891 Dr Konrad Burger published an
appendix to it containing an Index of Printers, since greatly
enlarged in his index to Dr Copinger&rsquo;s <i>Supplement to Hain</i> (1902).
The form of the index enables each printer&rsquo;s work to be seen at a
glance, and the impetus given to the study of the history of
printing was very great. But if the book had originally been
arranged under Printers instead of Authors, it would have been
far more difficult to use; its literary value would have been
halved, and the record of the output of each press, now instantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page911" id="page911"></a>911</span>
visible, would have been obscured by the fuller entries causing
it to extend over many pages.</p>

<p><i>The Bibliography of Bibliography.</i>&mdash;The zeal of students of
early printing has provided the material for an almost exhaustive
list (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Incunabula</a></span>) of the books printed in the 15th century
still extant. Of those printed in the years 1501-1536 there is a
tentative enumeration in the continuation of Panzer&rsquo;s <i>Annales
Typographici</i> (1803), and materials are gradually being collected
for improving and extending this. But the projects once formed
for a universal bibliography have dwindled in proportion as the
output of the press has increased, and the nearest approaches
to such a work are the printed catalogue of the library of the
British Museum, and that of the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris,
now in progress. Of books of great rarity unrepresented in these
catalogues a fairly sufficient record exists in Brunet&rsquo;s <i>Manuel
du libraire</i>, the bibliographical collections of Mr W.C. Hazlitt,
the <i>Bibliographer&rsquo;s Manual</i> by Lowndes, and the other
bibliographical works enumerated in the article on book-collecting
(<i>q.v.</i>). When a universal bibliography was recognized as an
impossibility, patriotism suggested the compilation of national
bibliographies, and the <i>Bibliotheca Britannica</i> of Robert Watt
(Edinburgh, 1824) remains an extraordinary example of what
the zeal of a single man could accomplish in this direction.
Quérard&rsquo;s <i>La France littéraire</i> (Paris, 1827-1839), while it gives
fuller titles, is much less comprehensive, embracing mainly
books of the 18th and early 19th centuries, and only such of
these as appeared to the compiler to be written by &ldquo;savants,
historiens, et gens de lettres.&rdquo; In the works of Heinsius
(<i>Allgemeines Bücherlexikon, 1700-1815</i>, Leipzig, 1812-1817), and
Kayser (<i>Bücherlexikon, 1750</i>, &amp;c., Leipzig, 1834, &amp;c.) Germany
possesses a fine record of her output of books during the last
two centuries, and since the organization of the book-trade,
contemporary lists of books, with <i>résumés</i> and indexes issued
at intervals, exist for most European countries. For the period
before these became of importance in England much bibliographical
material has been collected in the Catalogues of
English Books printed up to the end of the year 1640, issued
by the British Museum in 1884, by the John Rylands library,
Manchester, in 1895, and by the University library, Cambridge,
in 1900-1906. A similar record of the rich English collections
in the Bodleian library, Oxford, remains a great <i>desideratum</i>.
While these substitutes for a universal author catalogue have
gradually been provided, similar contributions to a universal
subject catalogue have been made in the form of innumerable
special bibliographies compiled by students or bookmen interested
in special subjects or departments of literature. The
most important of these are enumerated in the bibliographical
notes appended to articles in this Encyclopaedia, but many
attempts have been made to compile separate catalogues of them.</p>

It was the capital of the Aedui in the time of Julius Caesar.

Augustodunum (Autun), to destroy the free native traditions.
Another far more obscure town in Gaul, near Reims, also bore

<p><span class="bold">BIBULUS,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> a surname of the Roman gens Calpurnia. The best-known
of those who bore it was Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus,
consul with Julius Caesar, 59 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He was the candidate put
forward by the aristocratical party in opposition to L. Lucceius,
who was of the party of Caesar; and bribery was freely used,
with the approval of even the rigid Cato (Suetonius, <i>Caesar</i>, 9),
to secure his election. But he proved no match for his able
colleague. He made an attempt to oppose the agrarian law
introduced by Caesar for distributing the lands of Campania,
but was overpowered and even personally ill-treated by the
mob. After making vain complaints in the senate, he shut
himself up in his own house during the remaining eight months
of his consulship, taking no part in public business beyond
fulminating edicts against Caesar&rsquo;s proceedings, which only
provoked an attack upon his house by a mob of Caesar&rsquo;s
partisans. His conduct gave rise to the jest, that Julius and
Caesar were consuls during that year. When the relations of
Caesar and Pompey became strained, Bibulus supported Pompey
(Plutarch, <i>Cato Minor</i>, 41) and joined in proposing his election as
sole consul (52 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Next year he went to Syria as proconsul
and claimed credit for a victory gained by one of his officers
over the Parthians, before his own arrival in the province.
After the expiration of his term of office, Pompey gave him command
of his fleet in the Ionian Sea. He proved himself utterly
incapable; his chief exploit was the burning of thirty transports
on their return from Epirus whither they had succeeded in
conveying Caesar and some troops from Brundusium. He died
soon afterwards (48) of fatigue and mortification (Caesar, <i>Bell.
Civ.</i> iii. 5-18; Dio Cassius xli. 48). Although not a man of great
importance, Bibulus showed great persistency as the enemy of
Caesar. Cicero says of him that he was no orator, but a careful
writer. By his wife Porcia, daughter of Cato, afterwards married
to Brutus, he had three sons. The two eldest were murdered
in Egypt by some of the soldiery of Gabinius; the youngest,
Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus, fought on the side of the republic
at the battle of Philippi, but surrendered to Antony soon
afterwards, and was by him appointed to the command of his fleet.
He died (about 32) while governor of Syria under Augustus.
He wrote a short memoir of his step-father Brutus, which was
used by Plutarch (Appian, <i>B.C.</i> iv. 136; Plutarch, <i>Brutus</i>,
13. 23).</p>

the south (Dorchester), west, north-east and east.</p>

<p>Bicester (Berncestre, Burencestre, Bissiter), according to the
Domesday survey, was held by Robert d&rsquo;Oily. In 1182 Gilbert
Basset founded here an Augustinian priory, which from that
date until its dissolution in 1538 became the centre of the
industrial life and development of the town. In 1253 William
Longspey obtained a grant of a fair at the feast of St Edburg,
and a Friday market is mentioned in the 14th century. Richard
II. granted a Monday market and a fair at the feast of St James
the Apostle, and in 1440 an additional market was granted to be
held in that part of the town called Bury-End, from this date
known as Market-End. Bicester never possessed any manufactures
of importance, but the fairs and markets were much
frequented, and in the 16th century the cattle market was
especially famous.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BICHAT, MARIE FRANÇOIS XAVIER<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (1771-1802), French
anatomist and physiologist, was born at Thoirette (Jura) on the
14th of November 1771. His father, a physician, was his first
instructor. He entered the college of Nantua, and afterwards
studied at Lyons. In mathematics and the physical sciences
he made rapid progress, but ultimately devoted himself to the
study of anatomy and surgery, under the guidance of M.A.
Petit (1766-1811), chief surgeon to the Hôtel Dieu at Lyons.
The revolutionary disturbances compelled him to fly from
Lyons and take refuge in Paris in 1793. He there became a
pupil of P.J. Desault, who was so strongly impressed with his
genius that he took him into his house and treated him as his
adopted son. For two years he actively participated in all the
labours of Desault, prosecuting at the same time his own
researches in anatomy and physiology. The sudden death of
Desault in 1795 was a severe blow to Bichat. His first care was
to acquit himself of the obligations he owed his benefactor, by
contributing to the support of his widow and her son, and by
conducting to a close the fourth volume of Desault&rsquo;s <i>Journal de
Chirurgie</i>, to which he added a biographical memoir of its author.
His next object was to reunite and digest in one body the surgical
doctrines which Desault had published in various periodical
works. Of these he composed <i>&OElig;uvres chirurgicales de Desault,
ou tableau de sa doctrine, et de sa pratique dans le traitement des
maladies externes</i> (1798-1799), a work in which, although he
professes only to set forth the ideas of another, he develops
them with the clearness of one who is a master of the subject.
In 1797 he began a course of anatomical demonstrations, and
his success encouraged him to extend the plan of his lectures,
and boldly to announce a course of operative surgery. In
the following year, 1798, he gave in addition a separate course
of physiology. A dangerous attack of haemoptysis interrupted
his labours for a time; but the danger was no sooner past than
he plunged into new engagements with the same ardour as
before. He had now scope in his physiological lectures for a
fuller exposition of his original views on the animal economy,
which excited much attention in the medical schools at Paris.
Sketches of these doctrines were given by him in three papers
contained in the Memoirs of the Société Médicale d&rsquo;Émulation,
which he founded in 1796, and they were afterwards more fully
developed in his <i>Traité sur les membranes</i> (1800). His next
publication was the <i>Recherches physiologiques sur la vie et sur
la mort</i> (1800), and it was quickly followed by his <i>Anatomie
générale</i> (1801), the work which contains the fruits of his most
profound and original researches. He began another work,
under the title <i>Anatomie descriptive</i> (1801-1803), in which the
organs were arranged according to his peculiar classification of
their functions, but lived to publish only the first two volumes.
It was completed on the same plan by his pupils, M.F.R.
Buisson (1776-1805) and P.J. Roux (1780-1854).</p>

<p>Before Bichat had attained the age of eight-and-twenty he
was appointed physician to the Hôtel Dieu, a situation which
opened an immense field to his ardent spirit of inquiry. In the
investigation of diseases he pursued the same method of observation
and experiment which had characterized his researches
in physiology. He learned their history by studying them at
the bedside of his patients, and by accurate dissection of their
bodies after death. He engaged in a series of examinations,
with a view to ascertain the changes induced in the various
organs by disease, and in less than six months he had opened
above six hundred bodies. He was anxious also to determine
with more precision than had been attempted before, the
effects of remedial agents, and instituted with this view a series
of direct experiments which yielded a vast store of valuable
material. Towards the end of his life he was also engaged on
a new classification of diseases. A fall from a staircase at the
Hôtel Dieu resulted in a fever, and, exhausted by his excessive
labours and by constantly breathing the tainted air of the
dissecting-room, he died on the 22nd of July 1802. His bust,
together with that of Desault, was placed in the Hôtel Dieu by
order of Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BICHROMATES AND CHROMATES<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span>. Chromium trioxide
dissolves readily in water, and the solution is supposed to contain
chromic acid, H<span class="su">2</span>CrO<span class="su">4</span>; the salts of this acid are known as the
chromates. In addition to these normal salts, others exist,
namely bichromates, trichromates, &amp;c., which may be regarded
as combinations of one molecular proportion of the normal salt
with one or more molecular proportions of chromium trioxide.
The series will thus possess the following general formulae:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc">M<span class="su">2</span>CrO<span class="su">4</span></td> <td class="tcc">M<span class="su">2</span>Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span></td> <td class="tcc">M<span class="su">2</span>Cr<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">10</span> &amp;c.</td> <td class="tcc">(M = one atom of a</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcc">normal chromate</td> <td class="tcc">bichromate</td> <td class="tcc">trichromate</td> <td class="tcc">monovalent metal.)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Chromates.</i>&mdash;The alkaline chromates are usually obtained by
fusion of a chromium compound with an alkaline carbonate and an
oxidizing agent, such for example as potassium nitrate or chlorate.
The native chrome-ironstone (Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>·FeO) may be used in this way
as a source of such compounds, being fused in a reverberatory
furnace, along with soda-ash and lime, the oxidizing agent in this
case being atmospheric oxygen. They may also be prepared by
oxidizing chromium salts (in alkaline solution) with hydrogen
peroxide, chlorine, bleaching powder, potassium permanganate
and manganese dioxide. The majority of the chromates are yellow
in colour, and many of them are isomorphous with the corresponding
sulphates. The alkaline chromates are soluble in water, those of
most other metals being insoluble. By the addition of mineral
acids, they are converted rapidly into bichromates. They are easily
reduced in acid solution by sulphuretted hydrogen, and also by
sulphur dioxide to chromium salts. The chromates are stable
towards heat; they are poisonous, and may be recognized by the
yellow precipitates they give with soluble barium and lead salts.</p>

<p>Potassium chromate, K<span class="su">2</span>CrO<span class="su">4</span>, may be prepared by neutralizing
a solution of potassium bichromate with potassium carbonate or
with caustic potash. It crystallizes in yellow rhombic prisms, and
is readily soluble in water, the solution having a bitter taste and an
alkaline reaction. When heated in a current of sulphuretted hydrogen,
or carbon bisulphide, it yields a mixture of chromium sesquioxide
and sulphide. When heated with sulphur it yields chromium
sesquioxide. Sodium chromate, Na<span class="su">2</span>CrO<span class="su">4</span>·10H<span class="su">2</span>O, forms pale yellow
crystals isomorphous with hydrated sodium sulphate, Na<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span>·10H<span class="su">2</span>O.
It is deliquescent, and melts at 23° C. (M. Berthelot). By evaporation
of its aqueous solution at temperatures above 30° C. it may be obtained
in the anhydrous condition. Lead chromate, PbCrO<span class="su">4</span>, occurs
native as the mineral crocoisite, and may be obtained as an amorphous
pale yellow solid by precipitating a soluble lead salt by an
alkaline chromate. It is used as a pigment under the name &ldquo;chrome
yellow.&rdquo; When digested for some time with a caustic alkali it is
converted into a basic salt, PbCrO<span class="su">4</span>·PbO, a pigment known as
&ldquo;chrome red.&rdquo; It melts readily, and on cooling resolidifies to a
brown mass, which at moderately high temperatures gives off oxygen
and leaves a residue of a basic lead salt; for this reason fused lead
chromate is sometimes made use of in the analysis of organic compounds.
Silver chromate, Ag<span class="su">2</span>CrO<span class="su">4</span> is a dark red amorphous powder
obtained when silver nitrate is precipitated by an alkaline chromate.
It is decomposed by the addition of caustic alkalis, forming silver
oxide and an alkaline chromate.</p>

<p><i>Bichromates.</i>&mdash;The bichromates are usually of a red or reddish-brown
colour, those of the alkali metals being readily soluble in
water. They are readily decomposed by heat, leaving a residue
of the normal chromate and chromium sesquioxide, and liberating
oxygen; ammonium bichromate, however, is completely decomposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page913" id="page913"></a>913</span>
into chromium sesquioxide, water and nitrogen. Sulphuretted
hydrogen and sulphur dioxide reduce them in acid solution to the
condition of chromium salts.</p>

<p>Potassium bichromate, K<span class="su">2</span>Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span>, is obtained by fusing chrome
ironstone with soda ash and lime (see above), the calcium chromate
formed in the process being decomposed by a hot solution of
potassium sulphate. After the calcium sulphate has settled, the
potassium chromate solution is converted into bichromate by the
action of sulphuric acid, and the salt is allowed to crystallize. It
forms large triclinic prisms of specific gravity 2.6-2.7, which are
moderately soluble in cold water and readily soluble in hot water.
The solution is strongly acid in reaction and is very poisonous.
Potassium bichromate finds extensive application in organic chemistry
as an oxidizing agent, being used for this purpose in dilute sulphuric
acid solution, K<span class="su">2</span>Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span> + 4H<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span> = KaSO<span class="su">4</span> + Cr<span class="su">2</span>(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">3</span> + 4H<span class="su">2</span>O + 3O. On
the addition of concentrated sulphuric acid to a cold saturated
solution of the salt, red crystals of chromium trioxide, CrO<span class="su">3</span>,
separate (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chromium</a></span>), whilst when warmed with concentrated
hydrochloric acid and a little water, potassium chlorochromate is
produced. When heated with phosphorus trichloride in a sealed
tube to 160° C., potassium chlorochromate, phosphorus oxychloride,
potassium chloride, and a complex chromium oxide (possibly Cr<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">6</span>)
are produced (A. Michaelis, <i>Jour. prak. Chem.</i>, 1871, ii. 4, p. 452).
Potassium bichromate finds application in photography, in
calico-printing and in the preparation of bichromate cells. Sodium
bichromate, Na<span class="su">2</span>Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span>·2H<span class="su">2</span>O, may be obtained by the addition of the
requisite quantity of chromium trioxide to a solution of sodium
chromate. It crystallizes in hyacinth-red prisms, which are very
hygroscopic and melt at 320° C.</p>

<p><i>Trichromates.</i>&mdash;The trichromates are obtained by the addition of
nitric acid (of specific gravity about 1.2) to solutions of the bichromates.
They form rhombic crystals of a red or brown red or brown red
colour and are readily decomposed by warm water, with formation
of the bichromate.</p>

<p><i>Perchromic Acid.</i>&mdash;By the addition of hydrogen peroxide to a
solution of chromic acid, a fine blue coloration due to a perchromic
acid is produced which is readily absorbed by shaking out with
ether. The following formulae have been assigned to the compound:&mdash;H<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">2</span>·CrO<span class="su">3</span>
(H. Moissan, <i>Comptes rendus</i>, 1883, 97, p. 96);
H<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">2</span>·2HCrO<span class="su">4</span> (M. Berthelot, <i>Comptes rendus</i>, 1889, 108, p. 25);
Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span>·xH<span class="su">2</span>O (L.C.A. Barreswil, <i>Ann. chim. et phys.</i>, 1847 [3], 20,
p. 364), and CrO<span class="su">6</span>·3H<span class="su">2</span>O (T. Fairley, <i>Chem. News</i>, 1876, 33, p. 237).
The more recent investigations of H.G. Byers and E.E. Reed
(<i>Amer. Chem. Jour.</i>, 1904, 32, p. 503) show that if metallic potassium
be added to an ethereal solution of the blue compound at &minus;20° C.,
hydrogen is liberated and a purple black precipitate of the perchromate,
of composition KCrO<span class="su">4</span> or K<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">8</span>, is produced; this compound
is very unstable, and readily decomposes into oxygen and
potassium bichromate. Similar sodium, ammonium, lithium,
magnesium, calcium, barium and zinc salts have been obtained.
It is shown that the blue solution most probably contains the acid
of composition, H<span class="su">2</span>Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">8</span>, whilst in the presence of an excess of hydrogen
peroxide more highly oxidized products probably exist.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BICYCLE<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> (from prefix <i>bi</i> = twice, and <span class="grk" title="kyklos">&#954;&#8016;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> a circle,
wheel). The modern bicycle, as developed from the old velocipede
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cycling</a></span>), consists essentially of two wheels placed
one behind the other and mounted on a frame which carries a
saddle for the rider. Between the wheels is a crank-axle which
the rider drives by means of the cranks and pedals, and its
motion is transmitted to the rear or driving wheel either by a
chain which passes over two chain wheels, one fixed on the
crank-axle and the other on the hub of the rear wheel, or, in the
chainless bicycle, by a tubular shaft and two pairs of bevel-wheels.
The rear wheel is usually so arranged that it can
turn, when the bicycle is running by its own momentum, independently
of the chain and pedals (&ldquo;free-wheel&rdquo;), and a variable
speed gear is often provided so that the rider may at will alter
the ratio between the rate of revolution of the crank-axle and the
driving wheel. The front, or steering wheel, is mounted in a fork
having its two upper ends brazed into the &ldquo;crown,&rdquo; to which
also the lower end of the steering tube is brazed. The steering
tube is mounted by ball bearings in the socket tube, which forms
the forward portion of the rear-frame.</p>

<p>The highest quality of materials and the most accurate workmanship
are required to produce a first-class bicycle. Steel of
75 to 100 tons per sq. in. tensile strength is used in chains, spokes,
&amp;c. In balls and ball-races, hardness without brittleness, and
homogeneity are of primary importance. Broken balls, or even
traces of wear in bearings, are now seldom heard of in a first-class
bicycle. The process of case-hardening, whereby an extremely
hard outer skin is combined with a tough interior, has been
brought to a high degree of perfection, and is applied to many
parts of the bicycle, particularly chains, free-wheels and
toothed-wheel variable speed gears. Interchangeability of parts is
secured by working to the smallest possible limits of error of
workmanship.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Frames.</i>&mdash;Fig. 1 represents a road-racer. A full roadster would
have the handles a little higher relatively to the saddle, and would
be provided with mud-guards, free-wheel and sometimes a gear-case
and variable speed gear. Fig. 2 shows a lady&rsquo;s bicycle with gear-case
and dress-guard. The rear frame of the &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; type (fig. 1)
is subjected to very small stresses due to vertical load. The front
fork and steering post are subject to bending moment due to the
reaction from the ground in the direction <i>dcb</i>. A slight amount of
elasticity in the front fork adds considerably to the comfort in riding
over rough roads. When the brake is applied lightly to the front
wheel, the reaction from the ground falls more closely along the axis
of the front fork, and the bending moment at the crown is diminished.
If the front brake is applied harder the reaction from the ground
at d may pass through the crown, in which case the bending moment
at the crown is zero. Still harder application of the brake causes
a bending moment in the opposite direction. In fig. 1 the axes of
the top and bottom tubes of the rear frame are produced to meet at <i>a</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page914" id="page914"></a>914</span>
If the reaction from the ground is in the direction <i>da</i>, the top
and bottom tubes are subjected to pure compressive and tensile
stresses respectively. When no brake pressure is applied a bending
moment due to the overhang <i>ab</i> is superimposed on these tubes.
Thus a short socket head with top tube sloping downwards towards
the head gives a stronger frame than a horizontal top tube. The
steering axis <i>ef</i> is arranged so as to cut the ground at <i>f</i>, a little in
front of the point of contact <i>d</i> of the wheel with the ground,
giving a slight castor action, and making steering possible without
use of the handle-bar. The rake of the steering head (that is the
angle between <i>ef</i> and <i>bd</i>) and the set of the fork (that is the displacement
of the wheel centre <i>c</i> from the axis <i>ef</i>) may be varied within
tolerably large limits without much affecting the easy steering
properties of the bicycle. The transverse stresses on the rear frame
due to the action of pedalling are more severe than those due to the
vertical load. The pedal pressure is applied at a considerable distance
from the central plane of the bicycle, and the pedal pin,
cranks and crank-axle are subjected to a bending moment which
is transmitted by the ball bearings to the frame. The down-tube
from the seat lug to the crank-bracket and the bottom
tube from the foot of the steering socket tube to the crank-bracket
are made fairly stout to resist this bending moment.
Further, the pull of the chain causes a transverse bending moment
in the plane of the chain-stays, which must be stiff enough under
heavy pedal pressure.</p>

<p>The tubular portions of the frame are made of weldless cold-drawn
steel tube. The junctions or lugs are usually of malleable
cast iron, bored to fit the outside of the tube, the final union being
effected by brazing. In very light bicycles the tubes are kept thin,
22 or 24 W.G. (.028 in. or .022 in. thickness) at the middle, and are
strengthened at the ends by internal liners. Or butt-ended tubes
are employed, the tubes being drawn thicker at the ends than in
the middle. The steering post and fork sides especially should be
thus strengthened at their junction with the crown. Some of the best
makers use sheet steel stampings instead of cast lugs, greater lightness
and strength being secured, and in some cases the sheet steel lugs
are inside the tubes, so that the joints are all flush on the outside.
The front fork blades are best made of sheet steel stamped to shape
and with the edges brazed together to form a hollow tube. The
sheet steel that can be thus employed has a much higher elastic
limit than a weldless steel tube.</p>

<p><i>Bearings.</i>&mdash;Ball bearings are universally used. Each row of balls
runs between two ball-races of hardened steel, one on the stationary
member, the other on the rotating member. The outer is called the
&ldquo;cup,&rdquo; and the inner the &ldquo;cone.&rdquo; One of the four ball-races is
adjustable axially so that the bearing may run without any shake.
The ball-races are often made of separate pieces of steel, but the
crank-axle usually has the cones formed integral with it, the necessary
hardness being obtained by case-hardening. According as the
two cups face outwards or inwards the bearing is said to have outward
or inward cups, and according as the adjustable ball race is
the cone or cup, the bearing is said to be cone-adjusting or cup-adjusting.
Fig. 3 shows a ball-bearing hub with outward cups.
The hub-shell H is turned out of mild steel, and the cups C are
forced into the ends of the hub-shell and soldered thereto. A thin
washer W is then spun into the end, for the purpose of retaining oil,
and a thin internal tube T unites the two cups, and guides the oil
fed in at the middle of the hub to the balls. The projecting flanges
S are for the attachment of the tangent spokes used to build the
hub into the wheel. The spindle A has the two cones screwed on
it, one C<span class="su">1</span> against a shoulder, the other C<span class="su">2</span> adjustable. The spindle
ends are passed through the back-fork ends and are there adjusted
in position by the chain-tension adjusters. After adjustment the
nuts N clamp the spindle securely between the fork-ends. The
chain-wheel or free-wheel clutch is screwed on the end of the hub-shell,
with a right-hand thread. The chain being at the right-hand
side of the bicycle (as the rider is seated) the driving pull of the chain
tends to screw the chain-wheel tight against the shoulder. A
locking-ring R with a left-hand thread, screwed tight against the
chain-wheel, prevents the latter from being unscrewed by back-pedalling.
With a free-wheel clutch screwed on the hub, the locking-ring
may be omitted.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 shows one end of the cup-adjusting hub, with inward bearings.
The cones are formed of one piece with the spindles, and the
adjusting cup C is screwed in the end of the hub shell, and locked
in position by the screwed locking-ring R. The figure also illustrates
a divided spindle for facilitating the removal of the tire for repair
when required without disturbing the wheel, bearings, chain or gear-case.
The chain side of the hub-spindle, not shown in the figure, is
secured to the frame in the usual way; on the left side the spindle
S projects very little beyond the adjusting cup. A distance washer
W is placed between the end of the spindle S and the fork-end F.
A detachable screw-pin, or the footstep, P, passes through the
chain-adjusting draw-bolt B, the fork-end F, and the distance
washer W, and is screwed into the end of the spindle S, the hexagon
head of the detachable pin drawing all the parts securely together.
On unscrewing the detachable pin, the distance washer W drops
out of place, leaving a clear space for removing the tire without
disturbing any other part.</p>

<p>The inward-cups bearing retains more oil than the other form.
The pressure on a ball being normal to the surface of contact with
the ball race, and each ball touching two ball races, the two points
of contact must be in line with the centre of the ball. All the lines
of pressure on the balls of a row meet at a point <i>f</i> on the axis of the
spindle. The distance between the two points <i>f</i> (fig. 5) may be
called the virtual length of the bearing. Other things being equal,
the outward-cups bearing has a greater virtual length than the
inward-cups bearing. In hubs and pedals where the actual distance
between the two rows of balls is sufficient, this point is of little importance.
At the crank-axle bearing, however, where the pedal
pressure which produces pressure on the axle bearings is applied
at a considerable overhang beyond the ball-races, the greater virtual
length of the outward-cups is an advantage.</p>

<p>Fig. 5 shows diagrammatically the usual form of crank-axle
bearing which has inward-cups
and is cup-adjusting.
The end of
the bracket is split and
the cup after adjustment
is clamped in
position by the clamping
screw S. The usual
mode of fastening the
cranks to the axle is
by round cotters C with
a flat surface at a slight
angle to the axis, thus
forming a wedge, which
is driven in tight. The
small end of the cotter
projects through the
crank, and is screwed
and held in place by a nut. The chain-wheel at the crank-axle is
usually detachably fastened to the right-hand crank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page915" id="page915"></a>915</span></p>

<p>The Rudge-Whitworth crank-bracket has outward cups and is
cup-adjusting. The cranks are cotterless. Fig. 6 is a sectional view.
The left crank and axle are forged in one piece. The fastening of
the right crank and chain-wheel
is by multiple grooves
and teeth, this fastening being
better mechanically than the
cotter type.</p>

<p><i>Pedals.</i>&mdash;The pedal consists
of a pedal body, on which
the foot of the rider rests,
mounted by ball-bearings on
a pedal-pin, which is secured
to the end of the crank and
turns with it. The pedal body
is made in many forms, but
usually the bearing-cups are
contained in a tube from the ends of which project plates, carrying
rubber blocks, or serrated plates (rat-trap pedals), on which the
foot of the rider rests. Cone adjustment is most used. The fastening
of the pedal pin to the crank is best effected by screwing it up
against a shoulder, the right and left crank eyes being tapped with
right and left hand screws respectively. With this arrangement, if
the pedal pin screw is a slack fit in the crank eye, the pressure on
the pedal tends to screw it up against the shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Wheels.</i>&mdash;Bicycle and tricycle wheels are made on the &ldquo;suspension&rdquo;
principle, the spokes being of high-tenacity steel wire,
screwed up to a certain initial tension, thus putting a circumferential
compression on the rim. In the &ldquo;artillery&rdquo; wheel, the wooden
spokes are in compression, and the rim is under tension. The rims,
which are made to a section suitable for pneumatic tires (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tire</a></span>),
may be of sheet steel or aluminium alloy rolled to the required
section, either without joint or jointed by brazing or riveting.
Wood rims are used on racing bicycles, but in England are not
popular for roadster bicycles. Holes are drilled at or near the
central plane of the rim for the spoke nipples, which have shoulders
resting on the outer surface of the rim and shanks projecting through
the rim towards the hub. The spoke ends are screwed to fit the
nipples. The shank of the nipple has a square cut on its outside
surface by which it can be screwed up. The spoke flanges on the hub
are placed far apart and the spread of the spokes gives the wheel
lateral stability. Tangential rigidity under driving and braking is
obtained by fastening the spokes to the hub tangentially (figs. 1
and 2). The hub fastening of the spoke is simply obtained by forming
a hook and head on the spoke end, and passing it through a hole
in the hub flange. The best spokes are butted at the ends, <i>i.e.</i> made
of larger diameter than at the middle, to allow for screwing at one
end and the hook bend at the other.</p>

<p><i>Chains.</i>&mdash;There are two widely used types of chains. The
&ldquo;block&rdquo; chain (fig. 7) consists of a series of central blocks connected
by side plates. The &ldquo;roller&rdquo; chain (fig. 8) consists of a series
of outside and inside links. The outside link A is made up of
two steel side plates P united by two shouldered rivets R. The
inside link B consists of two side plates P united by two tubular
pieces T, which form bushes for the
rivets R and pivots for the rollers L. The
rivets, bushes and rollers are case-hardened.</p>

<p>Roller chains for cycles are made in
two pitches, ½ in. and <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in., and in widths
from <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. to ¼ in. between the side plates
of the inside links. The weight of 4 ft.
length (96 links) of a ½ in. pitch <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. wide
roller chain is about 12¼ oz., and its breaking
load is about 2000 &#8468; In a block chain
the ends of the blocks engage with the
teeth of the chain-wheels, and the same
surfaces continually coming into contact,
the wear may become excessive, especially
when exposed to mud and grit. In the
roller chain the outer surfaces of the rollers
engage with the teeth of the chain-wheels,
and during the engagement and disengagement
may roll slightly on the tubular
rivets. The surface of contact of the roller
and tubular rivet is not directly exposed
to the dust and grit from the road. The
rollers therefore serve the double purpose
of (1) transferring the relative motion of
the parts to a pair of surfaces under better
conditions as regards lubrication, and (2)
presenting a new part of the outside surface of the roller for the
next engagement with the chain-wheel. The durability of roller
chains is thus much greater than that of block chains, under
the usual conditions of cycling.</p>

<p><i>Chain-wheels.</i>&mdash;The pitch line of the chain-wheel is polygonal
(fig. 9), <i>a, b, c, d</i> being centres of adjacent joints of the chain when
lying in contact with
the wheel. The path
of the joint <i>a</i> of the
chain, relative to the
chain-wheel as it enters
on to and leaves the
chain-wheel, is evidently
the curve

The fullest possible
form of the tooth is
that between the two
parallel curves, of radii
less by an amount equal
to the radius of the
roller, as indicated in fig. 9. But since it is neither necessary nor
desirable that the roller should roll along the whole length of the
tooth, the radii of curvature of the tooth outline may be less than
shown in fig. 9. A good arrangement of tooth form is shown in fig. 10.</p>

<p>The rollers as they come in contact with the chain-wheel strike
it with a speed proportional to the angular speed of the chain-wheel
and to the pitch of the chain, causing a certain amount of noise.</p>

<p><i>Chain Adjustment.</i>&mdash;To keep the chain running at correct tension,
it is necessary to have some adjustment of the distance between
the crank-axle and hub. This is obtained either by an eccentric adjustment
at the crank-bracket, an eccentric adjustment at the
hub-spindle or by draw-bolts at the fork-ends, the last method being
most common.</p>

<p><i>Gear-case.</i>&mdash;The modern roller chain by makers of repute is so
durable that the necessity for a gear-case is not so great as when
chains were of inferior quality. But if the bicycle is to require the
minimum amount of care and attention a gear-case should be fitted.
The Sunbeam gear-case is built into the frame and is oil-retaining,
and the chain, chain-wheels, free-wheel and two-speed gear are
continually lubricated by an oil-bath. A detachable gear-case is not
usually oil-retaining, but serves to exclude grit and mud from the
chain.</p>

<p><i>Gear and Crank-length.</i>&mdash;The &ldquo;gear&rdquo; of a bicycle is given by the
formula Dn<span class="su">1</span>/n<span class="su">2</span> where D is the diameter of the driving wheel in
inches, n<span class="su">1</span> and n<span class="su">2</span> the numbers of teeth on the crank-axle and hub
chain-wheels respectively. At each revolution of the crank-axle,
the bicycle is moved forward a distance equal to the circumference
of the circle of diameter equal to the gear. Thus with a 28 in.
diameter driving-wheel, 18 teeth on the hub chain-wheel, 45 teeth
on the crank-axle chain-wheel, the bicycle is geared to 70 in. The
usual crank-length is 6½ to 7 in. Cranks of 7½, 8 and 9 in. length can
be had, but require a bicycle frame of special design. The gear should
be roughly proportional to the crank-length. The gear 10 times the
crank-length is a good proportion for an average rider.</p>

<p><i>Free-wheels.</i>&mdash;A free-wheel clutch transmits the drive in one
direction only, allowing the pedals to remain at rest at the will of
the rider, while the bicycle runs on. With a free-wheel, chain
breakages are reduced or nearly eliminated, as should the chain get
accidentally caught the free-wheel comes into play. There are three
principal types of free-wheel clutches&mdash;roller, ratchet and friction
cone. The roller type was the earliest in use, but has fallen into
disfavour. A sectional view of a ball-bearing ratchet free-wheel,
with outer cover removed, is shown in fig. 11. The ring on which
the three pawls and springs are carried is screwed on the end of
the hub; the chain-wheel is combined with an inner ratchet wheel
and is mounted by two rows of ball bearings on the pawl ring. The
friction cone type of free-wheel clutch is usually combined with a brake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page916" id="page916"></a>916</span>
inside the hub, the whole combination being termed a coaster hub.
Fig. 12 shows a sectional view of the Eadie two-speed coaster, in
which the free-wheel clutch and brake are combined with a two-speed
gear. The free-wheel clutch
action is as follows: A forward pressure
of the pedals turns the externally
threaded driving cone H in the internally
threaded cone F, the latter
being thus forced to the right into
engagement with the cup J which is
screwed to the hub-shell, thus forming
a friction driving clutch. The pedals
being held stationary the driving cone
H is stationary, and the hub running
on the ball bearings G, the cone F
travels towards the left until released
from the cup J, when it also remains
at rest. In this type of free-wheel
clutch it is essential that there be
little or no friction between the screwed surfaces of H and F,
else on beginning to pedal, the cone F may remain stationary
relative to the driving cone H, and no engagement between F and
J may take place. If F be prevented from turning faster than the
hub-shell, as is sometimes done by a light spring between the two,
the engagement of the friction clutch must take place as soon as
the pedals tend to move faster than the speed corresponding to
that of the hub-shell.</p>

<p><i>Brakes</i> of many types are used, differing in the place and mode
of application. The tire brake has fallen into disuse, rim brakes
and internal hub brakes being usual. The retarding force that can
be applied by a brake is limited by the possibility of skidding the
wheel. In riding at uniform speed, without acceleration, the greater
part of the load is on the rear-wheel; but as soon as the brake is
applied to cause retardation the wheel load distribution is altered,
more load being thrown on the front wheel. Thus the most powerful
brake is one applied to the front wheel. On the other hand,
a front-wheel brake often sets up an unpleasant vibration of the
front fork. On a greasy road too powerful pressure on the front-wheel
brake may cause a side-slip with no chance of recovery;
while with the back-wheel brake recovery is possible. The Bowden
system of transmission, which is largely used for cycle brake work,
consists of a steel stranded cable inside a flexible tube formed by a
closely wound spiral of steel wire, the cable being practically
inextensible and the spiral tube practically incompressible; if the
ends of the latter be fastened it forms a guide tube for the cable,
any movement given to one end of the cable being transmitted to the
other end. The spiral tube may be led round any corners, but the
frictional resistance of the cable inside the spiral tube increases with
the total angle of curvature of the guide tube; the laws of friction
of a rope passing over a drum apply. In fitting the Bowden system the
total curvature should therefore be kept as small as possible. With
a back-pedalling rim brake the cycle cannot be wheeled backwards
unless a special device is used to throw the operating clutch
out of action. A back-pedalling brake is most conveniently applied
inside the hub, as in the coaster hub. In the Eadie two-speed
coaster (fig. 12) the braking action is obtained by the expansion of
the steel band I against a phosphor bronze ring L carried by the
rotating hub-shell. The steel band I is mounted on a disk with a
projecting arm, the end of which is clipped to the frame tube. The
expansion of the steel band is effected by the movement of the lever
K fixed to the cone E. On moving the pedals backward the screw
drive-ring H forces the cone nut F with which it engages to the left
into contact with the cone E. The backward movement of the
pedals being continued sets up the required movement of the lever
K, and applies the brake.</p>

<p><i>Variable Speed Gears.</i>&mdash;The effort required to propel a bicycle
varies greatly, according to the conditions of road surface, gradient
up or down hill, wind against or behind. To meet these variable
conditions, a variable speed-gear is an advantage. The action of
the human motor is, however, so entirely different from that of a
mechanical motor that it is easy, without practical experience, to
over-estimate the value of a variable speed gear. Probably from
50 in. to 80 in. represents the greatest useful range of gear for an
average rider. With a gear lower than 50 in., the speed of climbing
a steep gradient is so slow that balancing difficulties begin, and it
is better to walk up. With 80 in. gear and 7 in. cranks, the speed
of pedalling, even at 25 miles an hour, is not irksome, provided the
conditions are favourable. For those who have not cultivated the
art of quick pedalling the useful range of gear under favourable
conditions may be extended to say 90 in. or 100 in. The gear-ratio
of a two-speed gear is the ratio of the high to the low gear. The
most suitable gear-ratio for any rider will depend upon his personal
physique and the nature of the country in which he rides. For
a middle-aged rider of
average physique a gear-ratio
of 125 : 100 is suitable,
for those of weaker
physique the gear-ratio
may with advantage be
greater, say 137.5 : 100;
while for road racing it
may be smaller, say 117:100.
With a three-speed
gear the low and high
gears should be chosen
respectively below and
above the single gear
which suits the rider, the
middle gear being about
the same as the rider&rsquo;s
usual single gear.</p>

<p>All the variable speed
gears at present made
consist of toothed wheel
mechanism either at the
hub or crank-bracket, and nearly all are based on the same
epicyclic train of toothed wheels. At one speed there is no
relative motion of the toothed wheels, the whole mechanism
revolving as one solid piece; this is called the &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
speed. At the other speed one part of the mechanism is held
stationary and the driven part revolves faster or slower than the
driver, according as the gearing is up or down. In some two-speed
gears the normal is the high speed, in others the low. In expressing
the gear-ratio, the normal speed will be denoted by 100. At the
normal gear there is of course no additional friction. The type of
two-speed gear used practically settles whether the normal gear is
at high or low speed; but it seems best, other things being equal,
to have the low speed the normal gear, as then the conditions
are worst. If the high speed is at normal gear, then at low speed
the chain gears up and the two-speed gear gears down; which is,
to say the least, a roundabout transmission.</p>

<p>Fig. 13 is a sectional view of the Sunbeam two-speed gear which
is arranged at the crank-axle, and clearly shows the relative
disposition of the toothed wheel mechanism common to nearly all
cycle speed gears. The chain-wheel is fixed to the annular wheel
A; the planet carrier C is fixed to the crank; and when the sun-wheel
D is held stationary, the chain-wheel is driven faster than
the cranks. When the
sun-wheel D is released,
the planet carrier C drives
the annular wheel A by
the ratchet free-wheel
clutch; the part thus
revolves as a solid piece,
and gives the normal or
low speed. The gear-ratio
is 133.3 : 100.</p>

<p>Fig. 14 is a sectional
view of the &ldquo;Hub&rdquo; two-speed
gear, the chain-wheel
or free-wheel
clutch being omitted. In
this the annular wheel is the driver, and the planet carrier is part
of the hub-shell. When the central pinion is held stationary the
hub is driven at a less speed than the chain-wheel; the gear-ratio
is 100 : 76.2.</p>

<p>In the Fagan two-speed gear, shown combined with the Eadie
coaster hub in fig. 12, the sun-wheel B can be moved laterally by
the striking gear, so as to engage with the chain-wheel centre C,
giving normal gear, or with an internally toothed wheel A fixed
to the spindle. The chain-wheel centre C carries the annular wheel,
and the four planet pinions D are mounted on the driving cone H.
Thus the gear gives a reduction of speed, the gear-ratio being 100 : 75.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page917" id="page917"></a>917</span>
The Sturmey-Archer three-speed hub (fig. 15) has gear-ratios
125 : 100 : 80. In the high gear position the epicyclic toothed wheels
are to the extreme left position. The chain-wheel is mounted by a
free-wheel on a drive-ring, with which the ends of the spindles of
the planet wheels engage at high gear. The sun-wheel, not shown
in the figure, is held stationary, and the annular wheel engages
with a ring screwed to the hub-shell, by means of keys engaging in
notches. The hub is thus driven at a higher speed than the chain-wheel.
For normal gear, the striking gear draws the internal
mechanism of the hub towards a central position, compressing a
spring, disengaging the sun-wheel and locking the drive-ring hub
and annular wheel together. At low gear, the internal mechanism
is drawn to the right-hand side, where the planet carrier engages
with the end plate of the hub by means of claw-clutches. The
annular wheel is still engaged with the drive-ring, and the sun-wheel
is again locked to the spindle. The hub is thus driven at a lower
speed.</p>

<p><i>Tandem Bicycles.</i>&mdash;The weight of a roadster tandem is about the
same as, or a trifle less than, that of two single roadster bicycles,
but the frictional resistance of the mechanism, the rolling resistance
of the tires, and the air resistance at a given speed are much less
than twice the values for a single bicycle. Consequently, much
higher speeds are attained on the level, and free-wheeling down
hill is much faster. On the other hand for riding up hill on a moderate
gradient, the effort required is about the same as on a single, while
on very steep gradients the tandem is at a slight disadvantage.
For the full enjoyment of tandem riding, therefore, a two-speed gear
is a necessity, while a three-speed gear is better. In the Raleigh
tandem (fig. 16) the frame design is such that it can be ridden by
two ladies, and the strength and rigidity is sufficient for two heavyweight
riders. The steering and control of the brakes is done by
the front rider. Connected steering is employed in some tandems,
allowing the rear rider to steer if necessary. For two expert tandem
riders, connected steering is slightly more pleasurable than fixed
handle grips for the rear rider, but on the other hand, divided
control may lead to disaster at a critical moment.
Most passengers on a tandem with connected steering unconsciously
give the steering a bias in one direction or the other, putting a
nervous strain on the steersman which becomes almost intolerable
towards the end of a long ride.</p>

<p><i>Motor Bicycles.</i>&mdash;Fig. 17 shows a touring motor bicycle, fitted
with luggage carrier and stand, the latter for supporting the bicycle
while at rest. The average speed of a motor bicycle being much
greater than that of a pedal bicycle the stresses on the frame due
to moving over rough roads are greater. This necessitates greater
strength and weight in all parts&mdash;frame, wheels and tires. To take
this increased weight up steep gradients requires increased engine
power. The weight of a touring motor bicycle may be from 150 to
200 &#8468; The drive is usually by a V belt of leather, or of canvas
and rubber, the angle of the V being 28°. The engine speed at maximum
power is from 1500 to 2000 revolutions a minute, and the belt
gears down in a ratio varying between <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> and <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span> according to the
cylinder capacity of the engine. The possibility of the belt slipping
slightly is conducive to smoothness of drive; chain-driving, except
in combination with a slipping clutch, is too harsh. The principal
defect of the belt drive is that the belt stretches, and on coming
to a steep hill may have to be tightened before the bicycle can be
driven up. The control of the speed and power of the engine is
effected by the throttle, extra air valve and spark advance, the
levers for which are all placed within convenient reach of the driver.
As the engine is almost invariably air-cooled, the skilful manipulation
of these three levers is essential for satisfactory results. On a good
level road when the engine may be working at a small fraction of
its maximum power, the proportion of air mixed with the petrol
vapour from the carburettor may be great, giving a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; mixture,
yet one rich enough to be ignited in the cylinder. The throttle
valve may be fully open and the spark advanced for high speed;
the throttle partially closed and spark retarded for slow speed.
Under these conditions the engine will run for an indefinite period
without overheating. Up a steep gradient, the mixture may have
to be made &ldquo;richer&rdquo; by partial closing of the extra air opening,
and as more heat is evolved, the cylinder walls may become overheated,
unless the engine power is sufficient to keep the bicycle
moving through the air at a good speed. As the engine cannot run
steadily at low speed, pedalling is resorted to for starting and for
riding slowly through traffic. For this purpose, an &ldquo;exhaust valve
lifter&rdquo; is usually fitted, by means of which the exhaust can be kept
permanently open, in order to relieve the resistance to pedalling
which the compression stroke would otherwise offer.</p>

<p>The nominal rating of the horse-power of a motor cycle engine
is rather vague and indefinite. A 3-H.P. engine may have a cylinder
of 76-80 mm. diameter and 76-80 mm. stroke. Twin-cylinder
engines, with one crank, are largely used, and some excellent
4-cylinder motor bicycles are made with bevel gear transmission.
The chief advantage of the multicylinder engine is the smoother
drive obtained.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;trailer&rdquo; with two wheels for carrying a passenger can be
attached to a motor bicycle, but the element of risk is increased.
A side-car, with one additional wheel, forms a safer passenger
carrier.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIDA,<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> a town and administrative district in the British
protectorate of Northern Nigeria. Bida town, situated in
9° 5&prime; N., 6° E., 25 m. N. by E. of Muraji on the Niger, is the
capital of the province of Nupe. It was founded in 1859 when
Fula rule was established in Nupe, is walled and of considerable
size. In 1909 it was connected by railway with Baro, 40 m.
S.S.E., the river terminus of the Northern Nigeria railway. The
inhabitants, mostly Hausa, carry on an extensive trade and are
especially noted for their embossed brass and copper work. The
Bida goblets, in which brass and copper are beautifully blended,
are of extremely elegant design. The town also boasts a glass
factory. The preparation of indigo and the dyeing of cloths are
other flourishing industries. The streets are planted with huge
shade-trees, so that as Bida is approached it looks like a forest.</p>

<p>In 1897 there was a two-days&rsquo; fight outside the walls of Bida
between the forces of the emir of Nupe and those of the Royal
Niger Company, ending in the defeat of the Fula army (mostly
cavalry). The victory was not followed at the time by a British
occupation, and the defeated king returned after the withdrawal
of the company&rsquo;s troops and re-established himself upon the
throne. In 1900 he allied himself with other hostile chiefs and
adopted an openly antagonistic attitude to the British government.
In 1901 it became necessary for British troops to march
on Bida. The emir fled, without fighting, to Kano. Another
emir was appointed in his place, and the province of Nupe was
placed under British administrative control. Since that date
the town has been peaceful and very prosperous. A mission
school has been established, and is attended by the sons of the
emir and of the principal chiefs, who are desirous of learning to
read and write English. The administrative district of Bida
includes the town and is the western division of the province of
Nupe (<i>q.v</i>.). (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nigeria</a></span>: <i>History</i>.)</p>

Saco river, opposite Saco, and on the Atlantic Ocean, 15 m. S.W.
of Portland. Pop. (1890) 14,443; (1900) 16,145, of whom 7,149
were foreign-born (mostly French Canadians); (census, 1910)
17,079. Biddeford is served by the Boston &amp; Maine railway, and
is connected by electric lines with Portland and with Old
Orchard Beach, a popular summer resort north of the Saco
river. The climate and the scenery in and about Biddeford
attract summer visitors and there are two resorts, Biddeford
Pool and Fortune Rocks within the municipal limits; but the
city is chiefly a manufacturing centre (third in rank among the
cities of the state in 1905)&mdash;good water-power being furnished
by the river&mdash;and cotton goods, foundry and machine shop
products and lumber are the principal products, the first being
by far the most important. The value of the factory products
increased from $5,472,254 in 1900 to $6,948,722 in 1905, or 27%.
There are large quarries of granite of excellent quality. A
permanent settlement was established on both sides of the river
about 1630 under the leadership of Richard Vines (1585-1651)
and was named Saco. In 1718 the present name was adopted.
In 1762 that portion of Biddeford which lay east of the river was
incorporated as the town of Pepperellborough, for which name
Saco was substituted in 1805. Biddeford was incorporated as a
city in 1855.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIDDER, GEORGE PARKER<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (1806-1878), English engineer,
was born at Moreton Hampstead, in Devonshire, on the 14th of
June 1806. From a very early age he manifested an extraordinary
natural aptitude for calculation, which induced his father,
who was a stone-mason, to exhibit him as a &ldquo;calculating boy.&rdquo;
In this way his talent was turned to profitable account, but his
general education was in danger of being completely neglected.
Interest, however, was taken in him by some of those who happened
to witness his performances, among them being Sir John
Herschel, and it was arranged that he should be sent to school
in Camberwell. There he did not remain long, being removed
by his father, who wished to exhibit him again, but he was saved
from this misfortune and enabled to attend classes at Edinburgh
University, largely through the kindness of Sir Henry Jardine,
to whom he subsequently showed his gratitude by founding a
&ldquo;Jardine Bursary&rdquo; at the university. On leaving college in 1824
he received a post in the ordnance survey, but gradually drifted
into engineering work. In 1834 Robert Stephenson, whose
acquaintance he had made in Edinburgh, offered him an appointment
on the London &amp; Birmingham railway, and in the succeeding
year or two he began to assist George Stephenson in his parliamentary
work, which at that time included schemes for railways
between London and Brighton and between Manchester and
Rugby via the Potteries. In this way he was introduced
to engineering and parliamentary practice at a period of great
activity which saw the establishment of the main features and
principles that have since governed English railway construction.
He is said to have been the best witness that ever entered a
committee-room. He was quick to discover and take advantage
of the weak points in an opponent&rsquo;s case, and his powers of mental
calculation frequently stood him in good stead, as when,
for example, an apparently casual glance at the plans of a railway
enabled him to point out errors in the engineering data that were
sufficient to secure rejection of the scheme to which he was
opposed. In consequence there was scarcely an engineering
proposal of any importance brought before parliament in connexion
with which his services were not secured by one party or
the other.</p>

<p>On the constructive side of his profession he was also
busily occupied. In 1837 he was engaged with R. Stephenson
in building the Blackwall railway, and it was he who designed
the peculiar method of disconnecting a carriage at each
station while the rest of the train went on without stopping,
which was employed in the early days of that line when it was
worked by means of a cable. Another series of railways with
which he had much to do were those in the eastern counties
which afterwards became the Great Eastern system. He also
advised on the construction of the Belgian railways; with R.
Stephenson he made the first railway in Norway, from Christiania
to Eidsvold; he was engineer-in-chief of the Danish railways;
and he was largely concerned with railways in India, where
he strongly and successfully opposed break of gauge on through-routes.
But though he sometimes spoke of himself as a mere
&ldquo;railway-engineer,&rdquo; he was in reality very much more; there
was indeed no branch of engineering in which he did not take
an interest, as was shown by the assiduity with which for half
a century he attended the weekly meetings of the Institution of
Civil Engineers, of which he was elected president in 1860. He
was one of the first to recognize the value of the electric telegraph.
That invention was in its infancy when, in 1837, jointly with R.
Stephenson he recommended its introduction on a portion of the
London &amp; Birmingham and on the Blackwall lines, while three
years later he advised that it should be adopted to facilitate the
working of the single line between Norwich and Yarmouth.
He was also one of the founders of the Electric Telegraph Company,
which enabled the public generally to enjoy the benefits
of telegraphic communication. In hydraulic engineering, he
was the designer of the Victoria Docks (London), being
responsible not only for their construction, but also for what was
regarded by some people at the time as the foolish idea of utilizing
the Essex marshes for dock accommodation on a large scale.
His advice was frequently sought by the government on points
both of naval and military engineering. He died at Dartmouth
on the 28th of September 1878.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">George Parker Bidder</span>, Junr. (1836-1896), who
inherited much of his father&rsquo;s calculating power, was a successful
parliamentary counsel and an authority on cryptography.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIDDING-PRAYER<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>biddan</i>, to pray, cf. Ger.
<i>beten</i>), the formula of prayer or exhortation to prayer said in
England before the sermon in cathedrals, at university sermons,
in the Inns of Court and elsewhere on special occasions. Such
formulae are found in the ancient Greek liturgies, <i>e.g</i>. that of St Chrysostom, in the Gallican liturgy, and in the pre-Reformation
liturgies of England. The form varies, but in all the characteristic
feature is that the minister tells the people what to pray
for. Thus in England in the 16th century it took the form of a
direction to the people what to remember in &ldquo;bidding their
beads.&rdquo; In course of time the word &ldquo;bid&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;pray&rdquo;
became obsolete and was confused with &ldquo;bid&rdquo; in the sense of
&ldquo;command&rdquo; (from O. Eng. <i>beodan</i>, to offer, present, and hence
to announce, or command; cf. Ger. <i>bieten</i>, to offer, <i>gebieten</i>, to
command), and the bidding-prayer has come practically to
mean the exhortation itself. A form of exhortation which
&ldquo;preachers and ministers shall move the people to join with
them in prayer&rdquo; is given in the 55th canon of the Church of
England (1603).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIDDLE, JOHN<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (1615-1662), frequently called the father of
English Unitarianism, was born on the 14th of January 1615,
at Wotton-under-Edge, in Gloucestershire. He was educated
at the grammar school of his native town and at Magdalen Hall,
Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1638 and proceeded M.A. in
1641, and was then appointed to the mastership of the free
school in the city of Gloucester, where &ldquo;he was much esteemed
for his diligence in his profession, serenity of manners and sanctity
of life.&rdquo; He also diligently prosecuted theological studies, and
the results he arrived at were of such a nature as to draw down
upon him the reprobation of the civic authorities. A treacherous
friend obtained the manuscript of his <i>Twelve Arguments drawn
out of Scripture, wherein the commonly received opinion touching
the deity of the Holy Spirit is clearly and fully refuted</i>; and in
December 1645 he was summoned before the parliamentary
committee then sitting at Gloucester. By them he was committed
to prison, though he was at the time labouring under a
dangerous fever. He was released on bail after a short imprisonment,
but was in July 1647 called before parliament, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page919" id="page919"></a>919</span>
desired to inquire into his views. After tedious proceedings,
during which Sir Henry Vane befriended him, Biddle was committed
to custody and his <i>Twelve Arguments</i>, which he had now
published, was ordered by parliament to be seized and burned
by the hangman. Notwithstanding this and the ordinance of
the 2nd of May 1648, visiting denial of the doctrine of the
Trinity with death, Biddle issued two tracts, one a <i>Confession
of Faith touching the Holy Trinity</i>, and the other <i>The Testimonies
of Irenaeus, &amp;c., concerning the one God and the Persons of the
Trinity</i> (1648). These were suppressed by government, and the
Westminster assembly of divines eagerly pressed for the passing
of an act by which heretics like Biddle could be put to death.
This, however, was resisted by the army, and by many of the
Independent parliamentarians; and after the death of the
king, Biddle was allowed to reside in Staffordshire under surveillance.
He engaged in preaching and in literary work,
particularly an edition of the Septuagint, published by Roger
Daniel. In February 1652 the general act of oblivion gave
him complete freedom, and his adherents soon began to meet
regularly for worship on Sundays. They were called Biddellians,
or Socinians, or Unitarians, the name which has now become
associated with their opinions. Biddle was not left long in
peace. He translated some Socinian books, among others the
<i>Life of Socinus</i>, and published two catechisms which excited
a fury of indignation. He was summoned before the parliament
in December 1654 and imprisoned. The dissolution of that body
again set him at liberty for a short time, but he was presently
brought up for some expressions used by him in a discussion
with John Griffin, an illiterate Baptist pastor, who invoked the
law against his superior opponent. He was put upon trial,
and was only rescued by Cromwell, who sent him (October 1655)
out of the way to one of the Scilly Islands, allowed him 100
crowns a year, and in 1658, on the solicitation of many friends,
released him. For a few years he lived and taught quietly
in the country, but returning to London he was in June 1662
again arrested, and fined £100. As he was unable to pay this
sum, he was at once committed to prison, where fever, caused
by the pestilential atmosphere, carried him off on the 22nd of
September 1662.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIDDLE, NICHOLAS<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (1786-1844), American financier, was
born in Philadelphia on the 8th of January 1786. He was
the nephew of a naval officer, Captain Nicholas Biddle (1750-1778),
who lost his life while fighting on the American side,
during the War of American Independence. After almost finishing
the prescribed course at the university of Pennsylvania, the boy
went to Princeton, where he graduated with high honours
in 1801. During 1804-1807 he was the secretary, first of John
Armstrong, minister to France, and then of James Monroe,
minister to Great Britain. After his return to America he practised
law for several years in Philadelphia, was an associate
editor of Dennie&rsquo;s <i>Portfolio</i>, to which he contributed both prose
and verse, and, with much literary skill, prepared for the press
from the explorers&rsquo; own journals a <i>History of the Expedition
under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark</i> (1814). He was
a prominent member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives
in 1810-1811 and of the Senate in 1814-1817, and in
1819 became, by President Monroe&rsquo;s appointment, one of the
five government directors of the Bank of the United States.
In 1823 he replaced Langdon Cheves as its president. In
general he followed a conservative policy and showed marked
ability in the management of the bank, but during President
Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s warfare upon that institution, his character
and his policy were violently assailed by the president and his
followers. The bank&rsquo;s national charter lapsed in 1836, but it
was immediately chartered by Pennsylvania as the &ldquo;Bank of
the United States, of Pennsylvania&rdquo;; and Biddle remained
president until 1839, two years before the bank failed. As
president of the board of trustees appointed for the purpose,
he took a prominent part in the establishment of Girard College,
in accordance with the will of Stephen Girard (<i>q.v</i>.). He died
in Philadelphia on the 27th of February 1844.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Charles John Biddle</span> (1819-1873), served in the
Mexican War as a captain of infantry, earning the brevet of major
at Chapultepec; practised law in Philadelphia; was a representative
in Congress in 1861-1863; was long editor-in-chief
of the Philadelphia <i>Age</i>; and published &rdquo;The Case of Major
André, with a Review of the Statement of it in Lord Mahon&rsquo;s

London &amp; South-Western and the Bideford, Westward Ho &amp;
Appledore railways. It is picturesquely situated on two hills
rising from the banks of the river Torridge, 3 m. above its junction
with the estuary of the Taw. Many of the houses are built with
timber framework in Elizabethan style, and the two parts of
the town are united by a bridge of 24 arches, originally erected
in the 14th century, when the revenue of certain lands was set
apart for its upkeep. The church of St Mary, with the exception
of the tower, is a modern reconstruction. A stone chancel
screen and a Norman font are also preserved. Industries
include the manufacture of earthenware, leather goods, sails,
ropes and linen, and ironfounding. The small harbour has
about 17 ft. of water at high tide, but is dry at low tide. Anthracite

<div class="condensed">
<p>Bideford (Bedeford, Bydyford, Budeford, Bytheford) is not
mentioned in pre-Conquest records, but according to Domesday it
rendered geld for three hides to the king. From the time of the
Conquest down to the 18th century, Bideford remained in the
possession of the Grenville family, and it first appears as a borough
in an undated charter (probably of the reign of Edward I.) from
Richard de Grenville, confirming a charter from his grandfather,
Richard de Grenville, fixing the rent and services due from the
burgesses and granting them liberties similar to those in use at
Breteuil and a market every Monday. Another charter, dated 1271,
confirms to Richard de Grenville and his heirs a market every Monday
and five days&rsquo; fair yearly at the feast of St Margaret (20th of July).
In 1573 Elizabeth granted a charter creating Bideford a free borough
corporate, with a common council consisting of a mayor, 5 aldermen
and 7 chief burgesses, together with a recorder, town-clerk and 2
serjeants-at-mace. This charter also granted the Tuesday market,
which is still held, and three annual fairs in February, July and
November, now discontinued. A later charter from James I. in
1610 added the right to have a town seal, 7 aldermen instead of 5,
and 10 chief burgesses instead of 7, and continued in force until
the Municipal Corporations Act of 1873, which established 4 aldermen
and 12 common councillors. In the 16th century Sir Richard
Grenville, the famous Virginian settler, did much to stimulate the
commercial development of Bideford, which long maintained a very
considerable trade with America, Spain and the Mediterranean ports,
the import of tobacco from Maryland and Virginia being especially
noteworthy. From the beginning of the 18th century this gradually
declined and gave place to a coasting trade in timber and coal,
chiefly with Wales and Ireland. The silk industry which flourished
in the 17th century is extinct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIDPAI<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Pilpay</span>), <b>FABLES OF</b>, the name given in the
middle ages (from Sanskrit <i>Vidya-pati</i>, chief scholar) to a famous
collection of Hindu stories. The origin of them is undoubtedly
to be found in the <i>Pancha Tantra</i>, or Five Sections, an extensive
body of early fables or apologues. A second collection, called the
<i>Hitopadesa</i>, has become more widely known in Europe than the
first, on which it is apparently founded. In the 6th century
<span class="scs">A.D.</span>, a translation into Pahlavi of a number of these old fables
was made by a physician at the court of Chosroes I. Anushirvan,
king of Persia. No traces of this Persian translation can now be
found, but nearly two centuries later, Abdallah-ibn-Mokaffa
translated the Persian into Arabic; and his version, which is
known as the &ldquo;Book of Kalilah and Dimna,&rdquo; from the two
jackals in the first story, became the channel through which a
knowledge of the fables was transmitted to Europe. It was
translated into Greek by Simeon Sethus towards the close of the
11th century; his version, however, does not appear to have
been retranslated into any other European language. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page920" id="page920"></a>920</span>
Hebrew version of Rabbi Joel, made somewhat later, was translated
in the 13th century into Latin by John of Capua, a converted
Jew, in his <i>Directorium vitae humanae</i> (first published in
1480), and in that form became widely known. Since then the
fables have been translated into nearly every European tongue.
There are also versions of them in the modern Persian, Malay,
Mongol and Afghan languages.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIEDERMANN, FRIEDRICH KARL<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (1812-1901), German
publicist and historian, was born at Leipzig on the 25th of
September 1812, and after studying at Leipzig and Heidelberg
became professor in the university of his native town in 1838.
His early writings show him as an ardent advocate of German
unity, and he was a member of the national parliament which
met at Frankfort in 1848. Becoming a member of the Upper
House of the parliament of Saxony, he advocated union under
the leadership of Prussia; and, subsequently losing his professorship,
he retired to Weimar, where he edited the <i>Weimarische
Zeitung</i>. Returning to Leipzig in 1863 he edited the
<i>Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, and regained his professorship in
1865. He was again a member of the Saxon Upper House, and
from 1871 to 1874 a member of the German Reichstag. He died
at Leipzig on the 5th of March 1901. Biedermann&rsquo;s chief works
are: <i>Erinnerungen aus der Paulskirche</i> (Leipzig, 1849); <i>Deutschland
im 18. Jahrhundert</i> (Leipzig, 1854-1880); <i>Friedrich der
grosse und sein Verhältnis zur Entwickelung des deutschen Geisteslebens</i>
(Brunswick, 1859); <i>Geschichte Deutschlands 1815-1871</i>
(Berlin, 1891); <i>Deutsche Volks- und Kulturgeschichte</i> (Wiesbaden,
1901). He also wrote the dramas, <i>Kaiser Heinrich IV.</i> (Weimar,
1861); <i>Kaiser Otto III.</i> (Leipzig, 1862); and <i>Der letzte Bürgermeister
von Strassburg</i> (Leipzig, 1870).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIEL, GABRIEL<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1425-1495), scholastic philosopher, was
born at Spires (Speier). He was the first professor of theology
at the newly founded (1477) university of Tübingen, of which
he was twice rector. Some years before his death he entered
a religious fraternity. His work consists in the systematic
development of the views of his master, William of Occam.
His <i>Epitome et Collectorium ex Occamo super libros quatuor
Sententiarum</i> (1508, 1512, and various dates) is a clear and
consistent account of the nominalist doctrine, and presents the
complete system of scholastic thought from that point of view.
The empirical individualism of the work, tending necessarily to
limit the province of reason and extend that of faith, together
with scattered utterances on special points, which gained for
Biel the title of <i>Papista Antipapista</i>, had considerable influence in
giving form to the doctrines of Luther and Melanchthon. It is
the best specimen of the final aspect of scholasticism. His other
works also have been frequently reprinted. The title <i>Ultimus
Scholasticorum</i> is often wrongly bestowed on Biel; scholasticism
did not cease with him, even in Germany, and continued to
flourish long after his time in the universities of Spain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIELEFELD,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of
Westphalia, 68 m. S.W. from Hanover on the main line to
Cologne. Pop. (1885) 34,931; (1905) 71,797. It is situated at
the foot of the Teutoburger Wald, and consists of two portions,
separated by the river Lutter, which were first united into one
town in 1520. Among its public buildings and institutions are
the old town church, with a curious carved altar-piece, the town
hall, the gymnasium and the provincial industrial school. On
the height above the town is the old castle of Sparenburg, built
in the 12th century by Bernhard, count of Lippe. It was for a
long time employed as a prison, but was restored after its
destruction by fire in 1877 and now contains a historical museum.
Bielefeld is the centre of the Westphalian linen industry. It has
also important plush, silk and hosiery manufactures, as well as
extensive bleaching works, and does a very large export trade
to all parts of the world in these branches. Engines, automobiles,
biscuits, glass, pianos, furniture and paper are also manufactured.</p>

<p>Bielefeld is mentioned as early as the 9th century, as <i>Belanvelde</i>,
but its first recorded mention as a town is in 1233. It
belonged at this time to the counts of Ravensberg, who often
resided in the Sparenburg. It joined the Hanseatic league in
1270, and about the same time began to engage in the linen
manufacture, which was greatly extended during the 16th and
17th centuries by a number of refugees from the Netherlands. In
1347 the town passed with the countship of Ravensberg to the
duchy of Jülich, and in 1666 to that of Brandenburg.</p>

chiefly German. It is situated on the Biala river, just opposite
the Galician town of Biala and possesses a fine castle belonging to
the Sulkowsky family, in favour of whom the lordship of Bielitz
was raised to a duchy in 1752. It has an important woollen and
linen industry, and manufactures of jute and machinery, as well
as an active trade, especially of woollens, to the East. The town
was founded in the 13th century, and in the 15th and 16th was a
fortified place.</p>

town, 3454; commune, 19,267. The old town (1558 ft.) lies on
a hill above the new town, and is reached from it by a cable
tramway. It has fine palaces with decorations in terra-cotta;
and a modern bath establishment is situated here. The new
town contains the 15th-century cathedral and the fine Renaissance
church of S. Sebastiano; near the former is a baptistery of the 9th
century. It is a considerable manufacturing centre for woollens,
silks and cottons, electric power being furnished by the torrents
descending from the mountains at the foot of which it lies.
It is frequented as a tourist centre, and several hydropathic
establishments and mountain resorts lie in the vicinity.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIENNE,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Biel</span>, an industrial town in the Swiss canton
of Bern. It is built between the N.E. end of the lake of the
same name and the point at which the river Suze or Scheuss
(on the right bank of which it is situated) issues from a deep cleft
(called the Taubenloch) in the Jura range. Bienne is 19 m. by
rail N.E. of Neuchâtel, and 21 m. N.W. of Bern. Its industrial
importance is shown by the fact that it is the site of the West
Swiss technical institute, which has departments for instruction
in watch-making, in electricity, in engraving and chasing, and
in subjects relating to railway, postal and telegraph matters. Its
chief industries are watch-making, chain-making, the manufacture
of machines and other objects for use on railways, &amp;c.
Its rapidly increasing commercial activity accounts no doubt for
the rapid rise in its population, which in 1850 was but 3589,
rose in 1870 to 8165, and in 1900 was 22,016, mainly Protestant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page921" id="page921"></a>921</span>
and two-thirds German-speaking. The parish church of St
Benedict dates from 1451, but was restored in 1775&mdash;it has
some fine 15th-century painted glass in the choir. In the town
is the Schwab museum, which is chiefly notable for its fine collection
of objects from the lake-dwellings. To the north-west of
Bienne two funicular railways lead up to Évilard (or Leubringen)
and Macolin (or Magglingen), both situated on the slope of the Jura.</p>

<p>First mentioned in the 12th century, Bienne continued for
centuries to be under the jurisdiction of the prince-bishop of
Basel. In 1279 (permanently in 1352) it made an alliance with
Bern, in 1344 with Soleure, and in 1382 with Fribourg. But its
attempts to be admitted into the Swiss Confederation were
fruitless, though after it adopted the Reformation in 1525, it
was closely associated with the Protestant cantons. In 1798
it was seized by the French, but in 1815, with the greater part
of the bishopric of Basel, it became part of the canton of Bern.</p>

a year old. In 1853-1856 he studied painting at Düsseldorf.
His pictures of the western part of the United States, and particularly
the Rocky Mountains, made him widely popular.
His &ldquo;Estes Park, Colorado,&rdquo; is in the collection of the earl of

<p><span class="bold">BIGAMY<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>bis</i>, twice, and Gr. <span class="grk" title="ghamos">&#947;&#940;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>, marriage),
in English law. according to the statute now in force (24 and
25 Vict. <i>c.</i> 100, § 57), the offence committed by a person
who &ldquo;being married shall marry any other person during
the life of the former husband or wife.&rdquo; In the canon law
the word had a rather wider meaning, and the marriage of a
clerk in minor orders with a widow came within its scope. At
the council of Lyons (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1274) bigamists were stripped of their
privilege of clergy. This canon was adopted and explained
by an English statute of 1276; and bigamy, therefore, became
a usual counterplea to the claim of <i>benefit of clergy</i>. However,
by an act of 1547 every person entitled to the benefit of clergy
is to be allowed the same, &ldquo;although he hath been divers times
married to any single woman or single women, or to any widow
or widows, or to two wives or more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bigamous marriage, by the ecclesiastical law of England, is
simply void. By a statute of 1604 the offence was made a felony.
This statute, after being repealed in 1828, was re-enacted and
reproduced in the Offences against the Person Act 1861. It is
immaterial whether the second marriage has taken place within
England and Ireland or elsewhere, and the offence may be dealt
with in any county or place where the defendant shall be apprehended
or be in custody. The following clause embodies the
necessary exceptions to the very general language used in
the definition of the offence.&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that nothing in this
section contained shall extend to any second marriage contracted
elsewhere than in England and Ireland by any other than a
British subject, or to any person marrying a second time whose
husband or wife shall have been continuously absent from such
person for the space of seven years then last past, and shall not
have been known by such person to be living within that time,
or shall extend to any person who at the time of such second
marriage shall have been divorced from the bond of the first
marriage, or to any person whose former marriage shall have
been declared void by any court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;
The punishment is penal servitude for not more than seven
nor less than five years, or imprisonment with or without hard
labour, not exceeding two years.</p>

<p>A valid marriage must be proved in the first instance in order
to support a charge of bigamy. A <i>voidable</i> marriage, such as
were marriages between persons within the prohibited degrees
before the Marriage Act 1836, will be sufficient, but a marriage
which is absolutely <i>void</i> as all such marriages now are, will not.
For example, if a woman marry B during the lifetime of her
husband A, and after A&rsquo;s death marry C during the lifetime of
B, her marriage with C is not bigamous, because her marriage
with B was a nullity. In regard to the second marriage (which
constitutes the offence) the English courts have held that it is
immaterial whether, but for the bigamy, it would have been a
valid marriage or not. An uncle, for example, cannot marry
his niece; but if being already married he goes through the
ceremony of marriage with her he is guilty of bigamy. In an
Irish case, however, it has been held that to constitute the offence
the second marriage must be one which, but for the existence of
the former marriage, would have been valid. With reference
to the case in which the parties to the first marriage have been
divorced, it may be observed that no sentence or act of any
foreign country dissolving <i>a vinculo</i> a marriage contracted in
England by persons continuing to be domiciled in England,
for grounds on which it is not liable to be dissolved <i>a
vinculo</i> in England will be recognized as a divorce (<i>R.</i> v.
<i>Lolley</i> 1812, R. &amp; R. 237). Hence, a divorce <i>a vinculo</i> for
adultery, in a Scottish court, of persons married in England, is
not within the statute. But if a person charged with bigamy
in England can prove that he has been legally divorced by the
law of the country where the divorced parties were domiciled at
the time (even though the ground on which the divorce was
granted was not one that would justify a divorce in England)
it will be good defence to the charge. Criminal jurisdiction is
always regarded as purely territorial, but bigamy (together
with homicide and treason) is an exception to this rule. A
British subject committing bigamy in any country may be tried
for the same in the United Kingdom (Earl Russell&rsquo;s case, 1901).</p>

<p>In Scotland, at the date of the only statute respecting bigamy,
that of 1551, cap. 19, the offence seems to have been chiefly
considered in a religious point of view, as a sort of perjury, or
violation of the solemn vow or oath which was then used in
contracting marriage; and, accordingly, it was ordained to be
punished with the proper pains of perjury.</p>

<p>Bigamy was punished in England until the reign of William
III. by death, then the penalty changed to life imprisonment
and branding of the right hand. An act of George I. still in
force lessened the penalty to deportation for seven years or
imprisonment for two years with or without hard labour. The
Offences against the Person Act 1861 changed deportation to
penal servitude.</p>

<p>In the United States the law in regard to bigamy is practically
founded on the English statute of 1604, with the exception that
imprisonment and a fine, varying in the different states, were
substituted instead of making the offence a felony. Congress
has passed a statute declaring bigamy within the territories
and places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page922" id="page922"></a>922</span>
States to be a misdemeanour (U.S. Rev. Stat. § 5352). By statute
in some states, upon absence of one spouse from the state for
five years without being heard of, the other may marry again
without committing bigamy, in other states the period is seven
years. In most of the states, prosecutions for bigamy are barred
after the lapse of a certain number of years. The marriage
wherever solemnized must be a valid marriage according to the
law of the place of solemnization; if void there, no prosecution
for bigamy can be founded upon it. In some jurisdictions,
an honest belief that a prior divorce of one of the parties was
valid would be a defence to a prosecution for bigamy, in others
the contrary is held.</p>

<p>On the continent of Europe, bigamy is punishable in most
countries with varying terms of imprisonment, with or without
hard labour, according to the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIGELOW, JOHN<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (1817-&emsp;&emsp;), American journalist and
diplomat, was born at Malden, New York, on the 25th of November
1817. He graduated at Union College in 1835, practised
law in New York for several years after 1839; took up journalistic
work; was joint owner (with William Cullen Bryant) and
managing editor of the New York <i>Evening Post</i> (1849-1861);
was United States consul at Paris in 1861-1864, and was
minister to France in 1864-1867. While consul, Bigelow wrote
<i>Les États-Unis d&rsquo;Amérique en 1863</i> in order to counteract the
apparent desire of the French people for a dissolution of the
American Union, by showing them the relative importance of
the commerce of the northern and southern states. On discovering
in 1863 that a French shipbuilder, with the connivance
of Napoleon III., was constructing two formidable iron-clads and
two corvettes for the use of the Confederacy, he devoted his
energies to thwarting this scheme, and succeeded in preventing
the delivery of all but one of these vessels to the Confederate
agents. In his work entitled <i>France and the Confederate Navy</i>
(New York, 1888) he gives an account of this episode. In 1865-1866,
it devolved upon Bigelow, as minister to France, to represent
his government in its delicate negotiations concerning the
French occupation of Mexico, and he discharged this difficult task
with credit. From 1875 to 1877 he served as secretary of state
of New York. He wrote books of travel, of popular biography,
or of historical or political discussion, &amp;c., from time to time;
but his principal literary achievements were editions, between
1868 and 1888, of Franklin&rsquo;s autobiography and autobiographical
writings, copiously annotated; and of the complete works of
Franklin, in ten octavo volumes (New York, 1887-1889). These
editions were based in part upon the editor&rsquo;s personal investigations
of manuscript sources in France and elsewhere, and supplanted
the well-known, long serviceable, but less accurate
edition of Jared Sparks (Boston, 1836-1840); they have in turn
been supplanted by the edition of A.H. Smythe (10 vols., 1905-1907).
Mr Bigelow was a close friend of Samuel J. Tilden, and
became his literary executor, editing his speeches and other
political writings (1885), publishing a biography in 1895, and
editing a two-volume collection of Tilden&rsquo;s letters and literary
memorials (1908). He also wrote a biography of William Cullen
Bryant (1890). In 1897 he published a volume entitled <i>The
Mystery of Sleep</i> (2nd ed., 1903). In 1909 he published
<i>Retrospections of an Active Life</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIGGAR,<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> a police burgh of Lanarkshire, Scotland. Pop.
(1901) 1366. It is situated about 10 m. S.E. of Carstairs
Junction (Caledonian railway), where the lines from Edinburgh
and Glasgow connect. Lying on Biggar Water and near the
Clyde, in a bracing, picturesque, upland country, Biggar enjoys
great vogue as a health and holiday resort. It was the birthplace
of Dr John Brown, author of <i>Rab and his Friends</i>, whose
father was secession minister in the town. It was created a
burgh of barony in 1451 and a police burgh in 1863. St Mary&rsquo;s
church was founded in 1545 by Lord Fleming, the head of the
ruling family in the district, whose seat, Boghall Castle, however,
is now a ruin. John Gledstanes, great-grandfather of W.E.
Gladstone, was a burgess of Biggar, and lies in the churchyard.
Easter Gledstanes, the seat of the family from the 13th to the
17th century, and the estate of Arthurshiels, occupied by them
for nearly a hundred years more, are situated about 3½ m.
to the north-west of the burgh. On the top of Quothquan Law
(1097 ft.), about 3 m. west is a rock called Wallace&rsquo;s Chair, from
the tradition that he held a council there prior to the battle of
Biggar in 1297. Lamington, nearly 6 m. south-west, is well
situated on the Clyde. It is principally associated with the family
of the Baillies, of whom the most notable were Cuthbert Baillie
(d. 1514), lord high treasurer of Scotland, William Baillie, Lord
Provand (d. 1593), the judge, and William Baillie (fl. 1648), the
general whose strategy in opposition to the marquess of Montrose
was so diligently stultified by the committee of estates.
The ancient church of St Ninian&rsquo;s has a fine Norman doorway.
Lamington Tower was reduced to its present fragmentary condition
in the time of Edward I., when William Heselrig, the
sheriff, laid siege to it. The defenders, Hugh de Bradfute and

some say, the wife of William Wallace&mdash;was conveyed to Lanark,

the whereabouts of her lover. Wallace exacted swift vengeance.
He burnt out the English garrison and killed the sheriff.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIGGLESWADE,<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> a market town in the Biggleswade parliamentary
division of Bedfordshire, England, 41 m. N. by W. of
London by the Great Northern railway. Pop. of urban district
(1901) 5120. It lies on the east bank of the Ivel, a tributary
of the Ouse, in a flat plain in which vegetables are largely grown
for the London markets. The town is a centre of this trade.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Biggleswade (Bichelswade, Beckeleswade, Bickleswade) is an
ancient borough by prescription which has never returned representatives
to parliament. The borough court was held by the lord
of the manor. At the time of Edward the Confessor, Archbishop
Stigand owned the manor, which according to Domesday passed to
Ralf de Insula. Henry I. granted it to the bishop of Lincoln, under
whose protection the borough evidently grew up. In 1547 the
bishop surrendered his rights to the king, and in the 17th century
Biggleswade formed part of the jointure of the queens of England.
Owing to its important position on the Roman road to the north
the town became an agricultural centre for the surrounding district.
In 1335 Edward III. renewed the bishop&rsquo;s licence to hold a Monday
market, and annual fairs were held here from very early times.
Those for horses are mentioned as famous by Camden. In addition
to agriculture, Biggleswade was formerly engaged in straw-plaiting
and lace manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIGNON, JÉRÔME<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (1589-1656), French lawyer, was born at
Paris in 1589. He was uncommonly precocious, and under his
father&rsquo;s tuition had acquired an immense mass of knowledge
before he was ten years of age. In 1600 was published a work by
him entitled <i>Chorographie, ou description de la Terre Sainte</i>.
The great reputation gained by this book introduced the author
to Henry IV., who placed him for some time as a companion to
the duc de Vendôme, and made him tutor to the dauphin,
afterwards Louis XIII. In 1604 he wrote his <i>Discours de la
ville de Rome</i>, and in the following year his <i>Traité sommaire
de l&rsquo;élection du pape</i>. He then devoted himself to the study of
law, wrote in 1610 a treatise on the precedency of the kings of
France, which gave great satisfaction to Henry IV., and in 1613
edited, with learned notes, the <i>Formulae</i> of the jurist Marculfe.
In 1620 he was made advocate-general to the grand council, and
shortly afterwards a councillor of state, and in 1626 he became
advocate-general to the parlement of Paris. In 1641 he resigned
his official dignity, and in 1642 was appointed by Richelieu
to the charge of the royal library. He died in 1656.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIGNON, LOUIS PIERRE ÉDOUARD<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1771-1841),
French diplomatist and historian, born on the 3rd of January
1771, was the son of a dyer at Rouen. Though he had received a
good education, he served throughout the early part of the
revolutionary wars without rising above the rank of private.
In 1797, however, the attention of Talleyrand, then minister of
foreign affairs, was called to his exceptional abilities by General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page923" id="page923"></a>923</span>
Huet, and he was attached to the diplomatic service. After
serving in the legations in Switzerland and the Cisalpine republic,
he was appointed in 1799 attaché to the French legation at
Berlin, of which three years later he became chargé d&rsquo;affaires.
As minister-plenipotentiary at Cassel, between the years 1804 and
1806, he took a prominent share in the formation of the confederation
of the Rhine; and after the battle of Jena he returned to
Prussia as administrator of the public domains and finances. He
filled a similar function in Austria after the battle of Wagram.
At the end of 1810 he became French resident at Warsaw and was
for a couple of years supreme in the affairs of the grand duchy.</p>

<p>The preparation of a constitution for Poland, on which he was
engaged, was, however, interrupted by the events of 1812.
Bignon, after a short imprisonment at the hands of the allies,
returned to France in time to witness the downfall of Napoleon.
During the Hundred Days he once more entered Napoleon&rsquo;s
service, and, after Waterloo, as minister of foreign affairs under
the executive commission, it was he who signed the convention of
the 3rd of July 1815, by which Paris was handed over to the
allies. Bignon did not re-enter public life until 1817, when he
was elected to the chamber of deputies, in which he sat until
1830, consistent in his opposition to the reactionary policy of
successive governments. His great reputation and his diplomatic
experience gave a special weight to the attacks which he published
on the policy of the continental allies, two of his works attracting
special attention. <i>Du Congrès de Troppau ou Examen des prétentions
des monarchies absolues à l&rsquo;égard de la monarchie constitutionelle
de Naples</i> (Paris, 1821), and <i>Les Cabinets el les peuples
depuis 1815 jusqu&rsquo;à la fin de 1822</i> (Paris, 1822).</p>

<p>The revolution of 1830, which brought his party into power,
only led to a very temporary resumption of office by Bignon.
He was for a few weeks minister of foreign affairs in the first
government of Louis Philippe, and again for a few weeks minister
of public instruction. But the idea of making him responsible
for the foreign policy of France could not be realized owing to the
necessity under which Louis Philippe lay of courting the goodwill
of the powers, whom Bignon had offended by his outspoken
writings. Elected deputy in 1831 and member of the chamber
of peers in 1839, he withdrew for the most part from politics, to
devote himself to his great work, the <i>Histoire de France sous
Napoléon</i> (10 vols. 1829-1838, then 4 posthumous vols., 1847-1850).
This history, while suffering from the limitations of all
contemporaneous narratives, contains much that does not exist
elsewhere, and is one of the best-known sources for the later
histories of Napoleon&rsquo;s reign.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIGOD, HUGH<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (d. 1177), earl of Norfolk, was the second son of
Roger Bigod (d. 1107), the founder of the English family of this
name. Hugh inherited large estates in East Anglia on the death
of his brother William in 1120, and enjoyed the favour of
Henry I. At first a supporter of Stephen during this king&rsquo;s
struggle with the empress Matilda, Hugh was rewarded with the
earldom of Norfolk before 1141. After having fought for the
king at the battle of Lincoln the earl deserted him, assumed a
position of armed neutrality during the general anarchy, and then
assisted Henry II. in his efforts to obtain the throne. This king
confirmed him in the possession of his earldom; but becoming
restless under the rule of law initiated by Henry, he participated
in the revolt of 1173, which so far as England was concerned
centred round his possessions. Though defeated and compelled
to surrender his castles, Bigod kept his lands and his earldom, and
lived at peace with Henry II. until his death, which probably took
place in Palestine.</p>

<p>His son <span class="sc">Roger</span> (d. 1221), who succeeded to the earldom of
Norfolk, was confirmed in his earldom and other honours by
Richard I., after he had fallen under the displeasure of Henry II.
He took part in the negotiations for the release of Richard from
prison, and after the king&rsquo;s return to England became justiciar.
The earl was one of the leaders of the baronial party which
obtained John&rsquo;s assent to Magna Carta, and his name appears
among the signatories to this document.</p>

<p>Roger was succeeded as 3rd earl by his son, Hugh, who died in
1225, leaving a son, <span class="sc">Roger</span> (d. 1270), who became 4th earl of
Norfolk. Through his mother, Matilda, a daughter of William
Marshal, earl of Pembroke, Roger obtained the office of marshal
of England in 1246. He was prominent among the barons who
wrested the control of the government from the hands of Henry
III., and assisted Simon de Montfort. The earl married Isabella,
daughter of William the Lion, king of Scotland, but left no sons.</p>

<p>Hugh, the 3rd earl, left a younger son, <span class="sc">Hugh</span> (d. 1266), who
was chief justiciar of England from 1258 to 1260, and who fought
for Henry III. at the battle of Lewes. The latter&rsquo;s son, <span class="sc">Roger</span>,
succeeded his uncle Roger as 5th earl of Norfolk in 1270. This
earl is the hero of a famous altercation with Edward I. in 1297,
which arose out of the king&rsquo;s command that Bigod should serve
against the king of France in Gascony, while he went to Flanders.
The earl asserted that by the tenure of his lands he was only compelled
to serve across the seas in the company of the king himself,
whereupon Edward said, &ldquo;By God, earl, you shall either go or
hang,&rdquo; to which Bigod replied, &ldquo;By the same oath, O king, I will
neither go nor hang.&rdquo; The earl gained his point, and after
Edward had left for France he and Humphrey Bohun, earl of
Hereford, prevented the collection of an aid for the war and forced
Edward to confirm the charters in this year and again in 1301.
Stubbs says Bigod and Bohun &ldquo;are but degenerate sons of mighty
fathers; greater in their opportunities than in their patriotism.&rdquo;
The earl died without issue in December 1306, when his title
became extinct, and his estates reverted to the crown. The
Bigods held the hereditary office of steward (<i>dapifer</i>) of the
royal household, and their chief castle was at Framlingham in
Suffolk.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIGOT,<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> one obstinately and intolerantly holding particular
religious opinions, who refuses to listen to reason and is ready
to force others to agree with him; hence also applied to one
who holds similar views on any subject. The early meaning of
the word in English, at the end of the 16th century, was that
of a religious hypocrite. The origin is obscure; it appears in
French, in the forms <i>bigot</i> or <i>bigos</i>, in the 12th century romance
of Girard of Roussillon, where it is applied to certain tribes of
southern Gaul, and in the <i>Roman du Rou</i> of Wace (d. 1175?)
as an abusive name given by the French to the Normans:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Moult on Franchois Normans laidis</p>
<p class="i05">et de meffais et de mesdis.</p>
<p class="i05">Souvent lor dient reproviers,</p>
<p class="i05">et claiment Bigos et Draschiers.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>To this use has been attached the absurd origin from &ldquo;<i>ne se, bi
god</i>,&rdquo; the words in which, according to the 12th century chronicle,
Rollo, duke of the Normans, refused to kiss the foot of Charles III.,
the Simple, king of the West Franks. The word may have some
connexion with a corruption of Visigoth, a suggestion to which
the use in the Girard romance lends colour. The meaning
changed in French to that of &ldquo;religious hypocrite&rdquo; through the
application, in the feminine <i>bigote</i>, to the members of the religious
sisterhoods called Beguines (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIGSBY, JOHN JEREMIAH<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (1792-1881), English geologist
and physician, the son of Dr John Bigsby, was born at Nottingham
on the 14th of August 1792. Educated at Edinburgh,
where he took the degree of M.D., he joined the army medical
service and was stationed at the Cape of Good Hope in 1817.
About a year later he went to Canada as medical officer to a
regiment, and having developed much interest in geology he was
commissioned in 1819 to report on the geology of Upper Canada.
In 1822 he was appointed British secretary and medical officer
to the Boundary Commission, and for several years he made
extensive and important geological researches, contributing
papers to the <i>American Journal of Science</i> and other scientific
journals; and later embodying an account of his travels in a
book entitled <i>The Shoe and Canoe</i> (1850). Returning to England
in 1827 he practised medicine at Newark until 1846 when he
removed to London, where he remained until the end of his life.
He now took an active interest in the Geological Society of
London, of which he had been elected a fellow in 1823. In 1869
he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1874 he was
awarded the Murchison medal by the council of the Geological
Society. During the last twenty years of his long life he was
continually at work preparing, after the most painstaking
research, tabulated lists of the fossils of the Palaeozoic rocks.
His <i>Thesaurus Siluricus</i> was published with the aid of the
Royal Society in 1868; and the <i>Thesaurus Devonico-Carboniferus</i>
in 1878. In 1877 he founded the Bigsby medal to be awarded
by the Geological Society of London, with the stipulation that
the receiver should not be more than forty-five years old. He
died in London on the 10th of February 1881.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIHARI<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (properly <i>Bih&#257;r&#299;</i>), the name of the most western of
the four forms of speech which comprise the Eastern Group of
modern Indo-Aryan Languages (<i>q.v.</i>). The other members are
Bengali, Oriya and Assamese (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bengali</a></span>). The number of
speakers of Bihari in 1901 was 34,579,844 in British India, out
of a total of 90,242,167 for the whole group. It is also the
language of the inhabitants of the neighbouring Tarai districts
of Nepal. In the present article it is throughout assumed that
the reader is in possession of the facts described under the heads
of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>. The article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bengali</a></span>
may also be studied with advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bih&#257;r&#299;&rdquo; means the language of the province of &ldquo;Bih&#257;r,&rdquo;
and to a certain extent this is a true description. It is the
direct descendant of the old M&#257;gadh&#299; Prakrit (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>), of
which the headquarters were South Bihár, or the present districts
of Patna and Gaya. It is, however, also spoken considerably
beyond the limits of this province. To the west it extends over
the province of Agra so far as the longitude of Benares, and to
the south it covers nearly the whole of the province of Chota
Nagpur. Allowing for the speakers in Nepal, its area extends
over about 90,000 sq. m., and the total number of people who
claim it as a vernacular is about the same as the population of
France. Bihari has been looked upon as a separate language
only during the past twenty-five years. Before that it was
grouped with all the other languages spoken between Bengal
and the Punjab, under the general term &ldquo;Hindi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The usual character employed for writing Bihari is that known
as <i>Kaith&#299;</i>, a cursive form of the well-known Nagari character of
Upper India. The name of the character is derived from the
<i>K&#257;yath</i> or <i>K&#257;yasth</i> caste, whose profession is that of scribes.
Kaithi is widely spread, under various names, all over northern
India, and is the official character of Gujarati. The Nagari
character is commonly employed for printed books, while the
Brahmans of Tirhut have a character of their own, akin to that
used for writing Bengali and Assamese. In the south of the
Bihari tract the Oriya character belonging to the neighbouring
Orissa is also found.</p>

<p>Bihari has to its east Bengali, also a language of the Outer
Band. To its west it has Eastern Hindi, a language of the
Intermediate Band (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span>). While it
must decidedly be classed as an Outer language, it nevertheless
shows, as might be expected, some points of contact with the
Intermediate ones. Nothing is so characteristic of Bengali as
its pronunciation of the vowel <i>a</i> and of the consonant <i>s</i>. The
first is sounded like the <i>o</i> in &ldquo;hot&rdquo; (transliterated <i>o</i>). In
Eastern Bihari the same vowel has a broad sound, but not so
broad as in Bengali. As we go westwards this broad sound is
gradually lost, till it entirely disappears in the most western
dialect, Bhojpur&#299;. As regards <i>s</i>, the M&#257;gadh&#299; Prakrit pronounced
it as <i>&#347;</i>, like the <i>sh</i> in &ldquo;shin.&rdquo; The Prakrits of the West preserved
its dental sound, like that of the <i>s</i> in &ldquo;sin.&rdquo; Here Bengali and
Eastern Hindi exactly represent the ancient state of affairs.
The former has the <i>&#347;</i>-sound and the latter the <i>s</i>-sound. At the
present day Bihari has abandoned the practice of the old M&#257;gadh&#299;
Prakrit in this respect, and pronounces its <i>s</i>&rsquo;s as clearly as in the
West. There are political reasons for this. The pronunciation
of <i>s</i> is a literal shibboleth between Bengal and Upper India.
For centuries Bihár has been connected politically with the
West, and has in the course of generations rid itself of the
typical pronunciation of the East. On the other hand, a witness
as to the former pronunciation of the letter is present in the fact
that, in the Kaithi character, <i>s</i> is always written <i>&#347;</i>. In the
declension of nouns, Bihari follows Bengali more closely than it
follows Eastern Hindi, and its conjugation is based on the same
principles as those which obtain in the former language.</p>

<p>The age of Bihari as an independent language is unknown.
We have songs written in it dating from the 15th century, and
at that time it had received considerable literary
culture. Bihari has three main dialects, which fall
<span class="sidenote">Language.</span>
into two divisions, an eastern and a western. The eastern
division includes <i>Maithil&#299;</i> or <i>Tirhuti&#257;</i> and <i>Magah&#299;</i>. Magahi is
the dialect of the country corresponding to the ancient Magadha,
and may therefore be taken as the modern representative of
the purest M&#257;gadh&#299; Prakrit. Its northern boundary is generally
the river Ganges, and its western the river Son. To the south
it has overflowed into the northern half of Chota Nagpur. It is
nearly related to Maithili, but it is quite uncultivated and has no
literature, although it is the vernacular of the birthplace of
Buddhism. Nowadays it is often referred to by natives of other
parts of the country as the typically boorish language of India.
Maithili faces Magahi across the Ganges. It is the dialect of
the old country of <i>Mithil&#257;</i> or <i>Tirhut</i>, famous from ancient times
for its learning. Historically and politically it has long been
closely connected with Oudh, the home of the hero R&#257;ma-candra,
and its people are amongst the most conservative in India.
Their language bears the national stamp. It has retained
numerous antiquated forms, and parts of its grammar are
extraordinarily complex. It has a small literature which has
helped to preserve these peculiarities in full play, so that though
Magahi shares them, it has lost many which are still extant in
the everyday talk of Mithila. The western division consists of
the Bhojpuri dialect, spoken on both sides of the Gangetic
valley, from near Patna to Benares. It has extended south-east
into the southern half of Chota Nagpur, and is spoken by at
least twenty millions of people who are as free from prejudice
as the inhabitants of Mithila are conservative. The Bhojpuris
are a fighting race, and their language is a practical one, made
for everyday use, as simple and straightforward as Maithili and
Magahi are complex. In fact, it might almost be classed as a
separate language, had it any literature worthy of the name.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(Abbreviations: Mth. = Maithili, Mg. = Magahi, Bh. = Bhojpuri,
B. = Bihari, Bg. = Bengali. Skr. = Sanskrit, Pr. = Prakrit. Mg. Pr. =
Magadhi Prakrit.)</p>

<p><i>Vocabulary.</i>&mdash;The Bihari vocabulary calls for few remarks.
<i>Tatsamas</i>, or words borrowed in modern times from Sanskrit (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span>), are few in number, while all the dialects
are replete with honest home-born <i>tadbhavas</i>, used (unlike Bengali)
both in the literary and in the colloquial language. Very few words
are borrowed from Persian, Arabic or other languages.</p>

<p><i>Phonetics.</i>&mdash;The stress-accent of Bihari follows the usual rules
of modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars. In words of more than one
syllable it cannot fall on the last, whether the vowel of that syllable
be long or short, pronounced, half-pronounced, or not pronounced.
With this exception, the accent always falls on the last long syllable.
If there are no long syllables in the word, the accent is thrown back
as far as possible, but never farther than the syllable before the
antepenultimate. Thus, <i>ki-s&#515;-n</i>(<i>a</i>) (final <i>a</i> not pronounced);
<i>p&#515;-n&#299;</i>, <i>há-m<span class="sp">a</span>-r&#257;</i>; <i>dé-kh<span class="sp">a</span>-l&#7843;-h<span class="sp">&#363;</span></i>. In the last word there is a secondary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page925" id="page925"></a>925</span>
accent on the penultimate, owing to the following imperfect
vowel (see below). When the first syllable of a word has not the
main stress-accent, it also takes a secondary one, as in <i>dè-kh<span class="sp">a</span>-li-ai-nh<span class="sp">i</span></i>.
When the letter a follows a syllable which has the accent
(secondary or primary) it is only half pronounced, and is here
denoted by a small <span class="sp">a</span> above the line. In Mth. (but not in Mg. or Bh.)
a final short <span class="sp">i</span> or <span class="sp">u</span> is often similarly very lightly pronounced, and
is then represented by the same device. Before such an &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo;
<span class="sp">i</span> or <span class="sp">u</span> the preceding syllable has a secondary accent, if it has
not already got the main one.</p>

<p>When a word ends in <i>a</i> preceded by a single uncompounded
consonant, the <i>a</i> is not pronounced; thus, <i>kis&#515;na</i>, sounded <i>kis&#515;n</i>.
This vowel is sometimes pronounced with a drawl, like the <i>a</i> in
&ldquo;ball,&rdquo; and is then transliterated <i>å</i>. When <i>a</i> has this sound it can
end a word, and in this position is common in the second person of
verbs; thus, <i>d&#275;khå</i>, see thou. This sound is very frequently heard
in Bhojpuri, and gives a peculiar tone to the whole dialect, which at
once strikes the casual hearer. The usual short form of the letter
<i>&#257;</i> is <i>a</i>, but when this would lead to confusion it is shortened in Mth.
and Mg. to a sound like that of <i>a</i> in the German <i>Mann</i>, and is then
transliterated <i>&#7843;</i>. In Bh. it is always shortened to <i>a</i>. As an example,
from <i>p&#257;n&#299;</i>, water, is formed the word <i>paniy&#257;</i>, but (in Mth. and Mg.)
from the word <i>m&#257;rab</i>, to strike, we have Mth. <i>m&#7843;r<span class="sp">a</span>l&#299;</i>, Mg. <i>m&#7843;r<span class="sp">a</span>l&#299;&prime;</i>, I
struck, because <i>mar<span class="sp">a</span>l&#299;</i> (<i>-l&#523;</i>) would mean &ldquo;I died.&rdquo; In Bh. <i>mar<span class="sp">a</span>l&#523;</i>
actually has both these meanings. The letters <i>e</i> and <i>o</i> may be either
long (<i>&#275;, &#333;</i>) or short (<i>e, o</i>). In Skr. the diphthongs <i>&#257;i</i> and <i>&#257;u</i> (here
transliterated <i>&#257;&#299;, &#257;&#363;</i>) are much longer than the Bihari <i>ai</i> and <i>au</i>,
which are contractions of only <i>a</i> + <i>i</i> and <i>a</i> + <i>u</i> respectively. We may
compare the Sanskrit, or <i>tatsama, &#257;&#299;</i> with the English &ldquo;aye,&rdquo; and
the <i>tadbkava ai</i> with the English &ldquo;I.&rdquo; In counting syllables in
Bihari, <i>ai</i> and <i>au</i> count each as two syllables, not each as one long
syllable. The Skr. <i>&#7769;</i> appears only in <i>tatsamas</i>. Nasalization of
vowels is extremely frequent. In this article it is represented by
the sign ~ over the vowel, as in <i>m&#363;h, m&#7843;r<span class="sp">a</span>l&#523;</i> and <i>dekh<span class="sp">a</span>lah<span class="sp">&#363;</span></i>.</p>

<p>As regards consonants, <i>&#7693;</i> and <i>&#7693;h</i>, when medial, are pronounced
as strongly burred <i>&#7771;</i> and <i>&#7771;h</i>, and are then transliterated as here
shown. There is a constant tendency to change these to an ordinary
dental <i>r</i> and <i>rh</i>; thus, <i>gh&#333;&#7693;&#257;</i>, pronounced <i>gh&#333;&#7771;&#257;</i> or <i>gh&#333;r&#257;</i>. The semivowels
<i>y</i> and <i>v</i> are always pronounced like <i>j</i> and <i>b</i> respectively,
unless they are simply euphonic letters put in to bridge the hiatus
between two concurrent vowels; thus <i>y&#257;&#363;vana</i> pronounced <i>j&#257;&#363;ban</i>,
and <i>maliy&#257;</i> for <i>mali-&#257;, gho&#7771;<span class="sp">a</span>w&#257;</i> for <i>gho&#7771;<span class="sp">a</span>-&#257;</i>. The sibilants <i>&#347;</i> and <i>s</i>
are both pronounced as a dental <i>s</i>, but (a relic of the old Mg. Pr.)
are both invariably written as a palatal <i>&#347;</i> in the Kaithi character.
Thus, the English word &ldquo;session&rdquo; (<i>se&#347;un</i>) is written <i>&#347;e&#347;an</i> and
pronounced <i>sesan</i>. The cerebral <i>&#7779;</i>, when uncompounded, is pronounced
<i>kh</i>. When compounded, it generally has its proper sound.
Thus, <i>&#7779;a&#7779;&#7789;ha</i>, sixth, is pronounced <i>kha&#7779;&#7789;h</i>. As a general statement
we may say that Bihari spelling is not fixed, and that there are often
many ways of writing, and sometimes two or three ways of pronouncing,
the same word.</p>

<p>The main typical characteristics of Mg. Pr. are that western Pr. <i>s</i>
becomes <i>&#347;</i>, and that western Pr. <i>r</i> becomes <i>l</i>. We have seen that
the change of <i>s</i> to <i>&#347;</i> occurs in Bengali but not in Bihari, and have
given reasons for the change back to <i>s</i> in the latter language, although
the Mg. Pr. <i>&#347;</i> is retained in writing. In both Bengali and Bihari, a
western <i>r</i> is not now represented by <i>l</i>, but is represented by <i>r</i>. This
deviation from the Mg. Pr. rule is only apparent, and is due to the
letter <i>r</i> representing two distinct sounds. In Skr., in the western
Prakrits, and in the modern western languages, <i>r</i> is a cerebral letter,
with a cerebral sound. In the modern eastern languages, <i>r</i> is a
dental letter, with a dental sound. Everywhere, both in old times
and at the present day, <i>l</i> was and is a dental letter. The meaning,
therefore, of the change from western Pr. <i>r</i> to Mg. Pr. <i>l</i> was that
the western <i>r</i> lost its cerebral sound, and became a dental letter,
like <i>l</i>. That dental character is preserved in the <i>r</i> of the modern
eastern languages. In fact, in Bihari <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> are frequently confounded
together, or with <i>n</i>, another dental letter. Thus, we have
<i>k&#257;l&#299;</i> or <i>k&#257;r&#299;</i>, black; <i>phar</i> or <i>phal</i>, fruit; Skr. <i>rajju-</i>, B.
<i>leju-r&#299;</i> a string; <i>Lakhnaur</i>, the name of a town, quite commonly pronounced
<i>Nakhlaul</i>; and the English names Kelly and Currie both pronounced
indifferently <i>kar&#299;</i> or <i>kal&#299;</i>. Compare Assamese <i>saril</i> for
<i>Skr. &#347;ar&#299;ra-</i>.</p>

<p>The genius of the Bihari language is adverse to the existence of
a long vowel in a <i>tadbhava</i> word, when it would occupy a position
more than two syllables from the end. Thus, <i>gh&#333;&#7771;&#257;</i>, but <i>gho&#7771;<span class="sp">a</span>w&#257;</i>;
<i>m&#257;rel</i>, but <i>m&#7843;r<span class="sp">a</span>l&#299;</i>. This is subject to various subsidiary rules which
will be found in the grammars. The principle is a most important
one, and, indeed, pervades all Indo-Aryan vernaculars of the present
day, but it is carried out with the greatest thoroughness and consistency
in Bihari. The whole system of declension and conjugation
is subject to it. When <i>&#257;</i> preceding <i>i</i> or <i>e</i> is shortened, the two
together become <i>ai</i>, and similarly a shortened <i>&#257;</i> + <i>u</i> or <i>o</i> become <i>au</i>.</p>

<p><i>Declension.</i>&mdash;Bihari has a stronger sense of gender than the other
languages of the Eastern Group. In the modern language the distinction
is in the main confined no animate beings, but in the older
poetry the system of grammatical, as distinct from sexual, gender
is in full swing. Except in the case of the interrogative pronoun,
there is no neuter gender&mdash;words which in Skr. and Pr. were neuter
being generally, but not always, treated as masculine. The plural
can everywhere be formed by the addition of some noun of multitude
to the singular, and this is the universal rule in Mth., but in Mg.
and Bh. it is generally made by adding <i>n</i> or (in Bh.) <i>nh</i> or <i>ni</i> to the
singular, before all of which a final vowel is shortened. Thus <i>gh&#333;&#7771;&#257;</i>,
a horse, <i>gh&#333;&#7771;an</i>, horses.</p>

<p>As for cases, the Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a locative&mdash;<i>hi</i> (<i>-hi</i>) and the ablative
<i>-hu</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>) terminations have survived in poetry, proverbs
and the like, and each of them can now be used for any oblique case;
but in ordinary language and in literature <i>-hi</i> and <i>-hi</i> have become
contracted to <i>&#7867;</i> and <i>&#275;</i>, the former of which is employed for the instrumental
and the latter for the locative case. Thus, <i>ghar</i>, house;
<i>ghar&#7867;</i>, by a house; <i>ghar&#275;</i>, in a house. The old termination <i>-hu</i> has
also survived in sporadic instances, under the form <i>&#7887;</i>, with an
ablative sense. Cases are, however, usually formed, as elsewhere,
by suffixing postpositions to a general oblique case (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan
Languages</a></span>). The oblique case in Bihari is generally the
same as the nominative, but nouns ending in <i>n, b, l</i> or <i>r</i>, and some
others, form it by adding <i>&#257;</i> (a relic of the old Mg. Pr. genitive in <i>&#257;ha</i>).
Thus, <i>maral</i>, the act of striking, obl. <i>m&#7843;r<span class="sp">a</span>l&#257;</i> (Mg. Pr. <i>m&#7843;ri-all&#257;ha</i>).
Another set of verbal nouns forms the oblique case in <i>ai</i>, <i>e</i> or <i>&#7843;</i>,
thus, Bh. <i>m&#257;r</i>, the ace of striking, <i>m&#257;r&#275;-la</i>, for striking, to strike.
In Mg. every noun ending in a consonant may have its oblique
form in <i>e</i>; thus, <i>ghar</i>, a house, <i>ghar-ke</i> or <i>ghare-ke</i>, of a house. The
<i>ai-</i> or <i>e-</i> termination is another relic of the Apabhrarhsa <i>-hi</i>, and the
<i>&#7843;</i> is a survival of the Ap. <i>-hu</i>.</p>

<p>The usual genitive postposition is <i>k</i>, which has become a suffix,
and now forms part of the word to which it is attached, a final
preceding vowel being frequently shortened. Thus, <i>gh&#333;&#7771;&#257;</i>, gen.
<i>gh&#333;&#7771;&#257;k</i>. Other genitive postpositions are <i>ke</i>, <i>kar</i> and <i>k&#275;r</i>. These,
and all other postpositions, are still separate words, and have not
yet become suffixes. The more common postpositions are<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Acc.-Dat.
<i>ke</i>; Instr.-Abl. <i>så, s&#275;</i>; Loc. <i>må., m&#275;</i>. The genitive does not
change to agree with the gender of the governing noun, as in Hindostani,
but in Bh. (not in Mth. or Mg.), when the governing noun is
not in the nominative singular, the genitive postposition takes the
oblique form <i>k&#257;</i>; thus, <i>r&#257;j&#257;-ke mandir</i>, the palace of the king; but
<i>r&#257;j&#257;-k&#257; mandir-m&#275;</i>, in the palace of the king. In Mth. and Mg.
pronouns have a similar oblique genitive in <i>&#257;</i>. There is no case
of the agent, as in Hindostani; the subject of all tenses of all verbs
being always in the nominative case.</p>

<p>Every noun can have three forms, a short, a long and a redundant.
The short form is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. Occasionally
both weak and strong forms occur for the same word;
thus, short weak, <i>gh&#333;&#7771;</i>; short strong, <i>gh&#333;&#7771;&#257;</i>; long, <i>gho&#7771;<span class="sp">a</span>w&#257;</i>;
redundant, <i>gho&#7771;auw&#257;</i>. This superfluity of forms is due to the existence
of the pleonastic suffix <i>-ka-</i> in the Prakrit stage of the language
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>). In that stage the <i>k</i> of the suffix was already elided,
so that we have the stages:&mdash;Skr. <i>gh&#333;&#7789;a-ka-s</i>, Pr. <i>gh&#333;&#7693;-a-u</i>, B. <i>gh&#333;&#7771;&#257;</i>
(by contraction) or <i>gho&#7771;<span class="sp">a</span>-w&#257;</i> (with insertion of a euphonic <i>w</i>). The
redundant form is a result of the reduplication of the suffix, which
was allowed in Pr. Thus. Skr. <i>*gh&#333;&#7789;a-ka-ka-s</i>, Pr. <i>gh&#333;&#7693;a-a-a-u</i>, B.
<i>gho&#7771;auw&#257;</i> (contracted from <i>gho&#7771;<span class="sp">a</span>-wa-wa-a</i>). The long and redundant
forms are mainly used in conversation. They are familiar and often
contemptuous. Sometimes they give a definite force to the word,
as <i>gho&#7771;<span class="sp">a</span>w&#257;</i>, the horse. In the feminine they are much used to form
diminutives.</p>

<p>As in other languages of the Eastern Group, the singulars of the
personal pronouns have fallen into disuse. The plurals are used
politely for the singulars, and new forms are made from these old
plurals, to make new plurals. The old singulars survive in poetry
and in the speech of villagers, but even here the nominative has
disappeared and new nominatives have been formed from the oblique
bases. All the pronouns have numerous optional forms. As a
specimen of pronominal declension, we may give the most common
forms of the first personal pronoun.</p>

<p>The important point to note in the above is that the oblique form
singular is formed from the genitive. It is the oblique form of that
case which is also used when agreeing with another noun in an
oblique case. Thus, <i>ham&#257;r ghar</i>, my house; <i>ham<span class="sp">a</span>r&#257; ghar-m&#7869;</i>, in my
house; <i>ham<span class="sp">a</span>r&#257;-k&#275;</i>, to me. In Mth. the nominative plural is also
the oblique form of the genitive singular, and in Bh. and Mg. it is
the oblique form of the genitive plural. In Bengali the nominative
plural of nouns substantive is formed in the same way from the
genitive singular (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bengali</a></span>). The usual forms of the pronouns
are <i>ham</i>, I; <i>t&#7757;</i>, <i>t&#7801;</i>, thou; Mth. <i>ap<span class="sp">a</span>nah<span class="sp">&#299;</span></i>, Bh. <i>raur&#257;</i>, Your Honour;
<i>&#299;</i>, this; <i>&#333;</i>, that, he; <i>j&#275;</i>, who; <i>s&#275;</i>, he; <i>k&#275;</i>, who? Mth. <i>k&#299;</i>, Mg.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page926" id="page926"></a>926</span>
Bh. <i>k&#257;</i>, what? <i>keo, keu</i>, any one; Mth. <i>kicch<span class="sp">u</span></i>, Mg. <i>kuchu</i>, Bh. <i>kachu</i>,
anything. The oblique forms of these vary greatly, and must be
learned from the grammars.</p>

<p><i>Conjugation in Maithili and Magahi.</i>&mdash;It is in the conjugation of the verb that the amazing complexity of the Mth. and Mg. grammars
appears. The conjugation of the Bhojpuri verb is quite simple, and
will be treated separately. In all three dialects the verb makes
little or no distinction of number, but instead there is a distinction
between non-honorific and honorific forms. In Mth. and Mg. this distinction
applies not only to the subject but also to the object, so that
for each person there are, in the first place, four groups of forms,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">In Mth. all the forms in which the object is honorific end in -<i>nh<span class="sp">i</span></i>.
Mg. closely follows this, but the forms are more abraded.</p>

<p>Forms in which the object is non-honorific may be, as in the case
of nouns, short, long or redundant. The long forms are made by
adding <i>ai</i> (or in the second person -<i>&#7843;h</i>) to the short forms, and the
redundant forms by adding <i>k</i> to the long forms. Again, if the
<i>object</i> is in the second person, the <i>ai</i> of the long and redundant forms
is changed to <i>au</i>. Finally, in the first person the
non-honorific and
honorific forms depending on the subject are the same, and are also
identical with those forms of the second person in which the subject
is honorific. We thus get the following paradigm of the Mth. past
tense of the verb <i>m&#257;rab</i>, to strike. The Mg. forms are very similar.
Besides the above there are numerous optional forms. Moreover,
these are only masculine forms. The feminine gender of the subject
introduces new complications. It is impossible here to go into all
these <i>minutiae</i>, interesting as they are to philologists. They must be learnt from the regular grammars. On the present occasion
we shall confine ourselves to describing the formation of the principal parts of the verb.</p>

<p>In Mth. the usual verb substantive and auxiliary verb is, as in
Bengali, based on the root <i>ach</i> (Skr. <i>&#7771;cchati</i>), the initial vowel being
generally dropped, as in <i>ch&#299;</i>, I am; <i>chalah<span class="sp">&#363;</span></i>, I was; but <i>ach<span class="sp">i</span></i>, he is.
In Mg. we have <i>h&#299;</i> or <i>hik&#299;</i>, I am; <i>hal&#363;</i>, I was. The finite verb has
three verbal nouns or infinitives, viz. (from the root <i>m&#257;r</i>, strike),
Mth. <i>m&#257;r<span class="sp">i</span></i> or Mg. <i>m&#257;r</i>; <i>m&#257;rab</i>; and <i>m&#257;ral</i>. All three are fully
declined as nouns, the oblique forms being <i>m&#257;rai</i> or <i>m&#257;re</i>, <i>m&#257;r<span class="sp">a</span>b&#257;</i>, and <i>m&#257;r<span class="sp">a</span>la</i>, respectively. There are two participles, a present (Mth.
<i>m&#7843;rait</i> = Pr. <i>m&#257;rentu</i>) and a past (Mth. <i>m&#257;ral</i> = Pr. <i>m&#257;ri-allu</i>). The
Mg. forms are very similar. The old Mg. Pr. present and imperative
have survived, but all other tenses are made from verbal nouns or
participles. The past tense (of which the conjugation for a Maithili
transitive verb is given above) is formed by adding pronominal
suffixes to the past participle. Thus, <i>m&#257;ral</i> + <i>i</i>, struck + by-me,
becomes <i>m&#7843;r&rsquo;l&#299;</i>, I struck. In the case of intransitive verbs, the suffixes may represent the nominative and not the instrumental
case of the pronoun, and hence the conjugation is somewhat different.
The future is a mixed tense. Generally speaking, the first two
persons are formed from the verbal noun in <i>b</i>, which is by origin
a future passive participle, and the third person is formed from the
present participle. Thus, <i>m&#257;rab</i> + <i>ah<span class="sp">&#363;</span></i>, about-to-be-struck + by-me,
becomes <i>m&#7843;r<span class="sp">a</span>bah<span class="sp">&#363;</span></i>, I shall strike, and <i>m&#7843;rait</i> + <i>&#7843;h</i>, striking + he,
becomes <i>m&#7843;r<span class="sp">a</span>t&#7843;h</i>, he will strike (compare the English &ldquo;he&rsquo;s going,&rdquo;
for &ldquo;he is on the point of going&rdquo;). A past conditional is also formed
by adding similar suffixes to the present participle, as in <i>m&#7843;ritah<span class="sp">&#363;</span></i>,
(if) I had struck. This use of the present participle already existed
in the Pr. age (cf. H&#275;ma-candra&rsquo;s <i>Grammar</i>, in. 180). In Mth. the
present definite and the imperfect are formed by conjugating the
present or past tense respectively of the auxiliary verb with the
present participle; thus <i>marait ch&#299;</i>, I am striking. Mg. (like vulgar
English) substitutes the oblique form of the verbal noun for the
present participle, as in <i>m&#257;re h&#299;</i>, I am a-striking. The perfect is
usually formed by adding the word for &ldquo;is&rdquo; to the past; thus,
Mth. <i>m&#7843;r<span class="sp">a</span>l&#299; ach<span class="sp">i</span></i>, I have struck, lit. struck-by-me it-is. A pluperfect
is similarly formed with the past tense of the auxiliary verb.</p>

<p>There are numerous irregular verbs. Most of the irregularities
are due to the root ending in a vowel or in a weak consonant such
as <i>b</i> (= Pr. <i>v</i>). Thus root <i>p&#257;b</i>, obtain, past participle <i>p&#257;ol</i>, first
singular, past tense, <i>paul&#299;</i>. More definitely irregular are a few roots
like <i>kar</i>, do, past participle <i>kail</i>. These last instances are cases in
which the past participle is independently derived from a Skr. past
participle, and is not formed as usual by adding the pleonastic
suffix -<i>al</i> or -<i>il</i> (Skr., Pr., <i>-alla-</i>, <i>-illa</i>-, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>) to the Bihari
root. Thus, Skr. <i>k&#7771;ta-s</i>, Pr. <i>kaa-u, ka-ill-u</i>, B. <i>kail</i>, instead of <i>kar-al</i>.</p>

<p>There is a long series of transitive verbs formed from intransitives
and of causal verbs formed from transitives, generally by adding
<i>&#257;b</i> (Skr. <i>&#257;paya</i>-, Pr. <i>&#257;v&#275;</i>-). Compound verbs are numerous. Noteworthy
is the desiderative compound formed by adding the root
<i>c&#257;h</i>, wish, to the dative of a verbal noun. Thus,
<i>ham d&#275;kh&#7843;-k&#275; cahait-ch&#299;</i>, I am wishing for the seeing, I wish to see.</p>

<p><i>Conjugation in Bhojpuri.</i>&mdash;The Bh. conjugation is as simple as
that of Mth. and Mg. is complex. In the first and second persons
the plural is generally employed for the singular, but there is no
change in the verb corresponding to the person or honour of the
object. The usual verb substantive and auxiliary verb is derived
in the present from the root <i>b&#257;&#7789;</i> or <i>b&#257;&#7771;</i>, be, as in <i>b&#257;&#7789;&#275;</i> or <i>b&#257;&#7771;&#275;</i> (Skr.
<i>vartat&#275;</i>, Pr. <i>va&#7789;&#7789;ai</i>), he is. The past is derived from the root <i>rah</i>
(Skr. <i>rahati</i>, Pr. <i>rahai</i>), as in <i>rah<span class="sp">a</span>l&#523;</i> or (contracted) <i>rah&#523;</i>, I was.
The verbal nouns and participles are nearly the same as in Mth.-Mg.,
the first verbal noun and the present participle being <i>m&#257;r</i> and
<i>m&#257;rat</i>, as in Mg. The old present and imperative, derived from the
Mg. Pr. forms, are also employed in Bh. Thus, <i>m&#257;r&#275;</i> (Pr. <i>m&#257;r&#275;i</i>),
he strikes. This tense is often used as a present conditional. When
it is wished to emphasize the sense of a present indicative, the
syllable -<i>l&#257;</i> is suffixed. The same suffix is employed in Rajasthani,
Naipali and Marathi to form the future, and in Bh. it is often also
used with a future sense. The past tense is formed, as in Mth.-Mg.,
by adding pronominal suffixes to the past participle; thus, <i>mar<span class="sp">a</span>l&#523;</i>
(<i>m&#257;ra</i> + <i>l&#523;</i>), I struck, as explained above. Similarly, for the first
and second persons of the future we have <i>mar<span class="sp">a</span>b&#523;</i>, I shall strike, and
so on, but the third person is <i>m&#257;r&#299;</i> (Pr. <i>m&#257;r&#275;hi</i>), he will strike, <i>marihen</i>
(Pr. <i>m&#257;r&#275;hinti</i>), they will strike. The periphrastic tenses are formed
on the same principles as in Mth. As an example of Bh. conjugation
we give the present, past and future tenses in all persons. There
are a few additional optional forms, but nothing like the multiplicity
of meanings which we find in Mth. and Mg.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the termination of the present changes
in sympathy with the old present to which it is attached. In some
parts of the Bh. area, especially in the district of S&#257;ran, <i>u</i> is substituted
for <i><span class="sp">a</span>l</i> in the past. Thus, <i>maru&#523;</i>, I struck. The <i>maru</i>- is
merely the past participle without the pleonastic termination <i>-alla-</i>
which is used in Bihari, as explained under the Mth.-Mg. conjugation.</p>

<p>Irregular verbs, the formation of transitive and causal verbs, and
the treatment of compound verbs, are on the same lines as in Mth.</p>

<p><i>Bihari Literature.</i>&mdash;In all three dialects there are numerous
folk-epics transmitted by word of mouth. Several have been
published at various times in the <i>Journal of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal</i> and in the <i>Zeitschrift der deutschen
morgenländischen Gesellschaft</i>. The only dialect which has any
<span class="sidenote">Literature.</span>
real literature is Maithili. The earliest writer of whom we have
any record is Vidyapati &#7788;hakkura (Bidyapati Thakur), who
lived at the court of R&#257;j&#257; &#346;iva Si&#7745;ha of Sugaon&#257; in Tirhut in
the 15th century. He was a voluminous Sanskrit writer, but
his fame rests chiefly on his dainty lyrics in Maithili dealing with
the loves of R&#257;dh&#257; and Krishna. These have exercised an
important influence on the religious history of eastern India.
They were adopted and enthusiastically recited by the reformer
Caitanya (16th century), and through him became the home-poetry
of the Bengali-speaking Lower Provinces. Their language
was transformed (we can hardly say translated) into
Bengali, and in that shape they have had numerous imitators.
A collection of poems by the old Master-singer in their Maithili
dress has been published by the present writer in his <i>Chrestomathy</i>
of that language. The most admired of Vidyapati&rsquo;s
successors is Manb&#333;dh Jh&#257;, who died in 1788. He composed a
<i>Haribans</i>, or poetical life of Krishna, which has great
popularity. Many dramas have been composed in Mithila. The fashion is
to write the body of the work in Sanskrit and Prakrit, but the
songs in Maithili. Two dramas, the <i>P&#257;rij&#257;ta-hara&#7751;a</i> and the
<i>Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-pari&#7751;aya</i>, are attributed to Vidy&#257;pati. Among modern
writers in the dialect, we may mention Har&#7779;an&#257;tha, an elegant
lyric poet and author of a drama entitled <i>U&#7779;&#257;-hara&#7751;a</i>, and
Candra Jh&#257;, whose version of the R&#257;may&#257;&#7751;a and translation of
Vidy&#257;pati&rsquo;s Sanskrit <i>Puru&#7779;a-par&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</i> are deservedly popular.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIH&#256;R&#298;-L&#256;L,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> a name famous in Hindustani literature as
the author of the <i>Sat-sa&#299;</i>, a collection of approximately seven
hundred distichs, which is perhaps the most celebrated Hindi
work of poetic art, as distinguished from narrative and simpler
styles. The language is the form of Hindi called <i>Braj-bh&#257;sh&#257;</i>,
spoken in the country about Mathura, where the poet lived.
The couplets are inspired by the Krishna side of Vishnu-worship,
and the majority of them take the shape of amorous utterances
of Radha, the chief of the Gopis or cowherd maidens of Braj,
and her divine lover, the son of Vasudeva. Each couplet is
independent and complete in itself, and is a triumph of skill
in compression of language, felicity of description, and rhetorical
artifice. The distichs, in their collected form, are arranged,
not in any sequence of narrative or dialogue, but according to
the technical classification of the sentiments which they convey
as set forth in the treatises on Indian rhetoric.</p>

<p>Little is known of the author beyond what he himself tells us.
He was born in Gwalior, spent his boyhood in Bund&#275;lkhand,
and on his marriage settled in his father-in-law&rsquo;s household
in Mathur&#257;. His father was named K&#275;sab R&#257;y; he was a twiceborn
(<i>Dwija</i>) by caste, which is generally understood to mean
that he was a Brahman, though some assert that he belonged
to the mixed caste, now called R&#257;y, sprung from the offspring
of a Brahman father by a Kshatriya mother. A couplet in the
<i>Sat-sa&#299;</i> states that it was completed in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1662. It is certain
that his patron, whom he calls Jai Sh&#257;h, was the R&#257;j&#257; of &#256;mb&#275;r
or Jaipur, known as M&#299;rz&#257; Jai Singh, who ruled from 1617 to
1667 during the reigns of the emperors Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, Sh&#257;h Jah&#257;n
and Aurangz&#275;b. A couplet (No. 705) appears to refer to an
event which occurred in 1665, and in which R&#257;j&#257; Jai Singh was
concerned. For this prince the couplets were composed, and
for each <i>d&#333;h&#257;</i> the poet is said to have received a gold piece worth
sixteen rupees.</p>

<p>The collection very soon became celebrated. As the couplets
are independent one of another, and were put together
fortuitously as composed, many different recensions exist; but the
standard is that settled by an assembly of poets under the
direction of Prince A&lsquo;zam Sh&#257;h, the third son of the emperor
Aurangz&#275;b (1653-1707), and hence called the A&lsquo;zam-sh&#257;h&#299;; it
comprises 726 couplets. The estimation in which the work is
held may be measured by the number of commentators who
have devoted themselves to its elucidation, of whom Dr Grierson
mentions seventeen. Two of them were Musalmans, and two
other commentaries were composed for Musalman patrons.
The collection has also twice been translated into Sanskrit.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best-known commentary is that of Lall&#363;-j&#299;-L&#257;l, entitled the
<i>L&#257;la-chandrik&#257;</i>. The author was employed by Dr Gilchrist in the
College of Fort William, where he finished his commentary in 1818.
A critical edition of it has been published by Dr G.A. Grierson
(Calcutta, government of India Press, 1896).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIJAPUR,<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> an ancient city and modern district of British
India in the southern division of Bombay. It is a station on the
Southern Mahratta railway, 60 m. S. of Sholapur. The ancient
city was supplied with water by an elaborate underground
system of reservoirs and aqueducts, which has been restored
in part as a famine relief work. The population in. 1901 was
23,811. The city used to be the extensive, splendid and opulent
capital of an independent sovereignty of the same name, but
now retains only the vestiges of its former grandeur. It is
still, however, the most picturesque collection of ruins in India.
The city of Bijapur owed its greatness to Yusuf Adil Shah, the
founder of the independent state of Bijapur. It consists of three
distinct portions&mdash;the citadel, the fort and the remains of the
city. The citadel, built by Yusuf Adil Shah, a mile in circuit,
is of great strength, well built of the most massive materials,
and encompassed by a ditch 100 yds. wide, formerly supplied
with water, but now nearly filled up with rubbish, so that its
original depth cannot be discovered. Within the citadel are the
remains of Hindu temples, which prove that Bijapur was an
important town in pre-Mahommedan times. The fort, which
was completed by Ali Adil Shah in 1566, is surrounded by a wall
6 m. in circumference. This wall is from 30 to 50 ft. high, and
is strengthened with ninety-six massive bastions of various
designs. In addition there are ten others at the various gateways.
The width is about 25 ft.; from bastion to bastion runs a
battlemented curtained wall about 10 ft. high. The whole is
surrounded by a deep moat 30 to 40 ft. broad. Inside these walls
the Bijapur kings bade defiance to all comers. Outside the
walls are the remains of a vast city, now for the most part in
ruins, but the innumerable tombs, mosques, caravanserais and
other edifices, which have resisted the havoc of time, afford
abundant evidence of the ancient splendour of the place. Among
its many buildings three are specially worthy of mention. The
Gol Gunbaz, or tomb of Sultan Mahommed Adil Shah, which
was built 1626-1656, is one of the most interesting buildings in
the world. It is a square building, 135 ft. each way, which is
surmounted by a great circular dome 198 ft. high. The inside area
(18,360 ft.) is greater than the Pantheon at Rome (15,833
sq. ft.). When first built the dome was covered by gold leaf,
and the outer walls were adorned with stucco work picked out
in gold and blue, but to-day there are very few traces of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page928" id="page928"></a>928</span>
ornamentation. Of late years this mosque has been thoroughly
restored, and one portion is now used as a museum in which all
objects of interest discovered in the surrounding country are
exhibited. Next to this comes the Ibrahim Roza, or tomb and
mosque of Ibrahim Adil Shah II., which was completed about
1620 and is supposed to be one of the most exquisite buildings
in the world after the Taj at Agra. It is said to have cost
£1,700,000 and to have occupied thirty-six years in its construction.
The Gagan Mahal, or ancient audience hall, is now
a mass of ruins, but when complete must have been a beautiful
building. The archway remains. It is over 60 ft. span and
about 90 ft. high. Through this arch Sikandar Adil Shah, the
last king of Bijapur, was brought bound with silver chains,
while on a raised platform sat Aurangzeb, the Mogul emperor,
who had left Delhi three years previously to conquer the Deccan.
This magnificent palace, where so many scenes historic in the
Bijapur dynasty occurred, is now the abode of hundreds of
pigeons. Their cooing is the only sound that breaks the silence
of the old halls.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The founder of the Bijapur dynasty, Yusuf Adil
Shah, is said by Ferishta to have been a son of the Ottoman
sultan Murad II. When on his accession Mahommed II. gave
orders for the strangling of all his brothers, Yusuf was saved by
a stratagem of his mother. He went to India, where he took
service under the Bahmani king of the Deccan, and ultimately
became a person of great importance at the court of Mahmud II.
In 1489 he took advantage of the break-up of the Bahmani
power to establish himself as an independent sultan at Bijapur,
his dominions including Goa on the west coast. He died in 1511
(Goa had been taken by the Portuguese a few months before),
and was succeeded by his son Ismail, who reigned prosperously
till 1534. The next king worth mentioning is Ali Adil Shah I.,
who reigned from 1557 to 1579 and, besides the fort, built the
Jama Masjid or great mosque, the aqueducts and other notable
works in the city. His son Ibrahim (d. 1626) maintained the
prosperity of the state; but under his successor, Mahommed
Adil Shah (d. 1656), the rise of the Mahratta power under Sivaji
began to make inroads upon it, and it was exposed to the yet
more formidable ambition of Shah Jahan. On the death of
Mahommed the succession passed to Ali Adil Shah II., and on
his death in 1672 to his infant son, Sikandar Adil Shah, the last
of the race. The kingdom had been for some time rapidly falling
to ruin, and in 1686 the Mogul emperor Aurangzeb, who as Shah
Jahan&rsquo;s general had unsuccessfully besieged the city under
Mahommed Adil Shah, took Bijapur and annexed the kingdom
to the Delhi empire. Among the curiosities of the capital is the
celebrated monster gun (Malik-i-Maidan), stated to be the largest
piece of cast bronze ordnance in the world. It was captured
from the king of Ahmednagar by the king of Bijapur about the
middle of the 17th century. An inscription on the gun recording
that fact was erased by Aurangzeb, who substituted the present
inscription stating that he conquered Bijapur in 1686. The city
and territory of Bijapur remained annexed to Delhi till 1724,
when the nizam established his independence in the Deccan, and
included Bijapur within his dominions. His sway over this
portion of his acquisitions, however, was of brief duration; for,
being defeated by the Peshwa in 1760, he was compelled to
purchase peace by its cession to the Mahrattas. Upon the fall
of the Peshwa in 1818 Bijapur passed into the hands of the
British, and was by them included in the territory assigned to the
raja of Satara. In 1848 the territory of Satara was escheated
through the failure of heirs. The city was made the administrative
headquarters of the district in 1885.</p>

<p>The district of Bijapur, formerly called Kaladgi, occupies a
barren plain, sloping eastward from a string of feudatory
Mahratta states to the nizam&rsquo;s dominions. It contains an area
of 5669 sq. m., and its population in 1901 was 735,435, showing
a decrease of 8% compared with an increase of 27% in the
preceding decade, and a decrease of 21% in the period between
1872 and 1881. These changes in population reveal the effects
of famine, which was very severely felt in 1876-1878 and again
in 1899-1000. There is very little irrigation in the district.
The principal crops are millet, wheat, pulse, oil-seeds and cotton.
There are considerable manufactures of cotton and silk goods
and blankets, and several factories for ginning and pressing
cotton. The East Deccan line of the Southern Mahratta railway
traverses the district from north to south.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIJAWAR,<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> a native state of central India, in the Bundelkhand
agency. Area, 973 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 110,500; revenue,
£10,000. Forests cover nearly half the total area of the state,
which is believed to be rich in minerals, but lack of transport
facilities has hindered the development of its resources.</p>

<p>The state takes its name from the chief town, Bijawar (pop.
in 1901, 5220), which was founded by Bijai Singh, one of the
Gond chiefs of Garha Mandla, in the 17th century. It was
conquered in the 18th century by Chhatarsal, the founder of
Panna, a Rajput of the Bundela clan, by whose descendants it
is still held. It was confirmed to Ratan Singh in 1811 by the
British government for the usual deed of allegiance. In 1857
Bhan Pratap Singh rendered signal services to the British during
the Mutiny, being rewarded with certain privileges and a
hereditary salute of eleven guns. In 1866 he received the title
of maharaja, and the prefix <i>sawai</i> in 1877. Bhan Pratap was
succeeded on his death in 1899 by his adopted son, Sanwant
Singh, a son of the maharaja of Orchha.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIJNOR,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bijnaur</span>, a town and district of British India in
the Bareilly division of the United Provinces. The town is about
3 m. from the left bank of the Ganges. The population in 1901
was 17,583. There is a large trade in sugar. The American
Methodists have a mission, which maintains some aided schools,
and there is an English high school for boys.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Bijnor</span> has an area of 1791 sq. m. The
aspect of the country is generally a level plain, but the northern
part of it rises towards the Himalayas, the greatest elevation
being 1342 ft. above the sea-level. The Koh and Ramganga are
the principal rivers that flow through the district, and the
Ganges forms its western boundary. In 1901 the population
was 779,451, showing a decrease of 2% in the decade. The
country is watered in most parts by streams from the hills, but
a series of small canals has been constructed. Sugar is largely
exported. A line of the Oudh &amp; Rohilkhand railway from
Moradabad to Saharanpur runs through the district.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Of the early history of Bijnor even after it passed
under Mahommedan rule little is known with any certainty.
The district was ravaged by Timur in 1399, and thenceforward
nothing is heard of it till the time of Akbar, when it formed part
of the Delhi empire and so continued undisturbed, save for
occasional raids, so long as the power of the Moguls survived
intact. In the early part of the 18th century, however, the
Rohilla Pathans established their independence in the country
called by them Rohilkhand; and about 1748 the Rohilla chief
Ali Mahommed made his first annexations in Bijnor, the rest
of which soon fell under the Rohilla domination. The northern
districts were granted by Ali Mahommed to Najib Khan, who
gradually extended his influence west of the Ganges and at Delhi,
receiving the title of Najib-ud-daula and becoming paymaster
of the royal forces. His success, however, raised up powerful
enemies against him, and at their instigation the Mahrattas
invaded Bijnor. This was the beginning of a feud which continued
for years. Najib, indeed, held his own, and for the part
played by him in the victory of Panipat was made vizier of the
empire. After his death in 1770, however, his son Zabita Khan
was defeated by the Mahrattas, who overran all Rohilkhand.
In 1772 the nawab of Oudh made a treaty with the Rohillas,
covenanting to expel the Mahrattas in return for a money
payment. He carried out his part of the bargain; but the
Rohilla chieftains refused to pay. In 1774 the nawab concluded
with the government of Calcutta a treaty of alliance, and he now
called upon the British, in accordance with its terms, to supply
a brigade to assist him in enforcing his claims against the Rohillas.
This was done; the Rohillas were driven beyond the Ganges,
and Bijnor was incorporated in the territories of the nawab, who
in 1801 ceded it to the East India Company. From this time the
history of Bijnor is uneventful, until the Mutiny of 1857, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page929" id="page929"></a>929</span>
(on the 1st of June) it was occupied by the nawab of Najibabad
a grandson of Zabita Khan. In spite of fighting between the
Hindus and the Mahommedan Pathans the nawab succeeded in
maintaining his position until the 21st of April 1858, when he was
defeated by the British at Nagina; whereupon British authority
was restored.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIKANIR,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> a native state of India, in the Rajputana agency
with an area of 23,311 sq. m. The natural aspect of the country
is one desolate tract, without a single permanently running
stream. Its surface is overspread with undulating sand-hills
of from 20 to 100 ft. above the average level, and so loose that
men and quadrupeds stepping off the beaten track sink as if
in snow. Two streams, the Katli and Ghaggar, attempt to
flow through this dismal region, but are lost in its sands. Water
is very scarce, and is raised from wells of from 250 to 340 ft. in
depth. A few shallow salt lakes are filled by rain water, but they
dry up on the setting in of the hot weather, leaving a thick crust
of salt on their beds, which is used for commercial and domestic
purposes. The inhabitants are very poor. They live chiefly
by pasturage&mdash;rearing camels, of which their chief agricultural
stock consists, and horses of a fine breed, which fetch good
prices. From the wool which their sheep yield they manufacture
every article of native dress and good blankets. The other
industries are leather work, sugar-refining, goldsmith&rsquo;s work,
ivory carving, iron, brass, copper, stone masonry, tanning,
weaving, dyeing and carpentry. The principal towns are
Bikanir, the capital, Churu, Rajgarh, Ratangarh and Reni. In
1901 the population was 584,627, showing a decrease of 30%
due to the results of famine. The revenue is £141,000. The
military force consists of 500 men, besides the Imperial Service
Corps of the same strength. The schools include a high school
affiliated to the university of Allahabad, a school for the sons
of nobles, and a girls&rsquo; school called after Lady Elgin. The
railway from Jodhpur has been extended towards Bhatinda
in the Punjab; on the northern border, the Ghaggar canal
in the Punjab irrigates about 5000 acres. Drought is of common
occurrence. The famine of 1899-1900 was severely felt. The
city of Bikanir has a railway station. The city is surrounded by
a stone wall, 6 ft. thick, 15 to 30 ft. high and 3½ m. in circuit,
with five gates and three sally-ports. The citadel is half a mile
north-east of the city, and is surrounded by a rampart with
bastions. The population in 1901 was 53,075. There are
manufactures of fine blankets and sugar-candy.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;In the 15th century the territory which now forms
the state of Bikanir was occupied by Rajput clans, partly Jats,
partly Mahommedans. About 1465 Bika, a Rathor Rajput,
sixth son of Rao Jodha, chief of Marwar, started out to conquer
the country. By taking advantage of the rivalries of the clans
he succeeded; in 1485 he built the small fort at the capital
which still bears his name, and in 1488 began the building of the
city itself. He died in 1504, and his successors gradually
extended their possessions. In the reign of Akbar the chiefs of
Bikanir were esteemed among the most loyal adherents of the
Delhi empire, and in 1570 Akbar married a daughter of Kalyan
Singh. Kalyan&rsquo;s son, Rai Singh, who succeeded him in 1571,
was one of Akbar&rsquo;s most distinguished generals and the first
raja of Bikanir; his daughter married Selim, afterwards the
emperor Jahangir. Two other distinguished chiefs of the house
were Karan Singh (1631-1669), who in the struggle of the sons
of Shah Jahan for the throne threw in his lot with Aurangzeb,
and his eldest son, Anup Singh (1669-1698), who fought with
distinction in the Deccan, was conspicuous in the capture of
Golconda, and earned the title of maharaja. From this time
forward the history of Bikanir was mainly that of the wars with
Jodhpur, which raged intermittently throughout the 18th century.
In 1802, during one of these wars, Elphinstone passed through
Bikanir on his way to Kabul; and the maharaja, Surat Singh
(1788-1828), applied to him for British protection, which was,
however, refused. In 1815 Surat Singh&rsquo;s tyranny led to a
general rising of his <i>thakurs</i>, and in 1816 the maharaja again
applied for British protection. On the 9th of May 1818 a treaty
was concluded, and order was restored in the country by British
troops. Ratan Singh, who succeeded his father in 1828, applied
in vain in 1830 to the British government for aid against a fresh
outbreak of his <i>thakurs</i>; but during the next five years
dacoity became so rife on the borders that the government raised a
special force to deal with it (the Shakhawati Brigade), and of this
for seven years Bikanir contributed part of the cost. Henceforth
the relations of the maharajas with the British government
were increasingly cordial. In 1842 Ratan Singh supplied
camels for the Afghan expedition; in 1844 he reduced the dues
on goods passing through his country, and he gave assistance
in both Sikh campaigns. His son, Sardar Singh (1851-1872),
was rewarded for help given during the Mutiny by an increase
of territory. In 1868 a rising of the <i>thakurs</i> against his extortions
led to the despatch of a British political officer, by whom affairs
were adjusted. Sardar Singh had no son, and on his death
in 1872 his widow and principal ministers selected Dungar
Singh as his successor, with the approval of the British government.
The principal event of his reign was the rebellion of the
<i>thakurs</i> in 1883, owing to an attempt to increase the dues payable
in lieu of military service; this led to the permanent location
at Bikanir of a British political agent. Dungar Singh died in
1887 without a son, but he had adopted his brother, Ganga
Singh (b. 1880), who succeeded as 21st chief of Bikanir with the
approval of the government. He was educated at the Mayo
College at Ajmere, and was invested with full powers in 1898.
He attended King Edward&rsquo;s coronation in 1902, and accompanied
the British army in person in the Chinese campaign of 1901 in
command of the Bikanir Camel Corps, which also did good
service in Somaliland in 1904. The state owes to this ruler the
opening up of new railways across the great desert, which was
formerly passable only by camels, and the tapping of the valuable
coal deposits that occur in the territory. For his conspicuous
services he was given the Kaisar-i-Hind medal of the first class,
made an honorary major in the Indian army, a G.C.I.E., a
K.C.S.I., and A.D.C. to the prince of Wales.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BILASPUR,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> a town and district of British India in the Chhattisgarh
division of the Central Provinces. The town is situated
on the right bank of the river Arpa. It is said to have
been founded by a fisherwoman named Bilasa in the 17th
century, and it still retains her name. The place, however,
came into note only after 1741, the year of the Mahratta
invasion (see below), when a Mahratta official took up his abode
there and began to build a fort which was never completed.
In 1862 it was made the headquarters of the district. The
population in 1901 was 18,937. It is an important junction on
the Bengal-Nagpur railway, where the two lines from the west
meet on their way to Calcutta, 255 m. from Nagpur.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Bilaspur</span> has an area of 7602 sq. m. It
forms the upper half of the basin of the river Mahanadi. It is
almost enclosed on the north, west and east by ranges of hills,
while its southern boundary is generally open and accessible,
well cultivated, and closely dotted with villages embedded in
groups of fruit trees. The principal hills are&mdash;(1) the Maikal
range, situated in the north-western extremity of the district;
(2) a chain of hills forming part of the Vindbyan range, on the
north; (3) the Korba hills, an off-shoot of the Vindhyas, on
the eastern boundary; and (4) the Sonakhan block of hills, in
the vicinity of the Mahanadi river. The Mahanadi is the principal
river of the district, and governs the whole drainage and
river system of the surrounding country. It takes its rise in a
mountainous region which is described as the wildest of all wild
parts of the Central Provinces, crosses the Bilaspur boundary near
Seorinarain, and after a course of 25 m. in the south-eastern
extremity of the district enters Sambalpur district. Within
Bilaspur the river is everywhere navigable for six months in the
year. Minor rivers are the Sakri, Hamp, Tesua, Agar, Maniari,
Arpa, Kharod, Lilagar, Jonk and Bareri. The most important
affluents of the Mahanadi are the Seonath and Hasdu. Besides
the natural water supply afforded by the rivers, Bilaspur abounds
in tanks. There are large forest areas, those belonging to
the government covering over 600 sq. m. Sal (<i>Shorea robusta</i>)
is the chief timber tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page930" id="page930"></a>930</span></p>

<p>Bilaspur, which was formerly a very isolated tract, is now
traversed in three directions by lines of the Bengal-Nagpur
railway. It suffered severely from the famine of 1896-1897.
In 1897 the general death-rate was as high as 90 per thousand,
rising to 297 in Bilaspur town. It suffered no less severely in
1900, when in May the number of persons relieved rose to one-fourth
of the total population.</p>

<p>In 1901 the population was 1,012,972, showing a decrease of
13%, compared with an increase of 14% in the preceding
decade. In 1906, however, the new district of Drug was formed,
which took away 739 sq. m. from Bilaspur; the population on
this reduced area of Bilaspur in 1901 was 917,240.</p>

<p>Among the Hindu inhabitants of the district, the Chamars
and Pankas deserve particular notice. The former, who form
the shoemaker and leather-dealing caste of the Hindu community,
had always been held in utter contempt by the other
Hindu castes. But between 1820 and 1830 a religious movement,
having for its object their freedom from the trammels of caste,
was inaugurated by a member of the caste, named Ghasi Das,
who preached the unity of God and the equality of men. Ghasi
Das gave himself out as a messenger of God; he prohibited the
adoration of idols, and enjoined the worship of the Supreme
Being without any visible sign or representation. The followers
of the new faith call themselves <i>Satnamis</i>, or the worshippers of
<i>Satnam</i> or God. They do not keep the Hindu festivals and they
defy the contempt of the Brahmans. Ghasi Das, the founder
of the faith, was their first high priest. He died in 1850; his
son succeeded him, but was assassinated (it was said by the
Hindus), and the grandson succeeded him. The Pankas,
who form about a sixth of the population, are all Kabirpanthis,
or followers of Kabir, a religious reformer of the 15th
century. There is no great difference between the Kabir
Pankas and the Satnamis. They both abstain from meat and
liquor, marry at the age of puberty, ordinarily celebrate their
ceremonies through the agency of the elders of their own caste
and bury their dead. The Pankas worship the Supreme Being
under the name of <i>Kabir</i>, and the Chamars under the name
of <i>Satnam</i>; while each community has a high priest to whom
reverence is paid. At present the majority of the Pankas are
cultivators, though formerly all were weavers. The Gonds are
the most numerous among the aboriginal tribes, but so great
an intermixture has taken place between them and the Hindu
races that they have lost their language and most of their ethnical
characteristics, such as the flat forehead, squat nose, prominent
nostril, dark skin, &amp;c., and are scarcely distinguishable from
the other classes of the Hindu labouring population. In addition
to some of the Hindu deities which they worship, the Gonds
have their own gods&mdash;Bara Deva and Dula Deva. The Kanwars
are the next largest section of the aboriginal population.
The upper class among them claim to be Rajputs, and are divided
into numerous septs. Although an aboriginal tribe, the census
returns them as a Hindu caste. All the northern landholders
of Bilaspur belong to this tribe, which consequently occupies
an influential position.</p>

<p>The chief wealth of the district consists in its agricultural
produce. Rice, wheat, pulses, millet, mustard, oil-seeds and
cotton are the chief crops. Rice, the chief export, is sent to
Bombay, Berar and northern India. The tussur silk industry
is of considerable importance, and the silk is reputed the best
in the Central Provinces. Sal and other timber is exported.
Lac is sent in large quantities to Calcutta and Mirzapur. Coal
and iron are the chief minerals; sandstone for building purposes
is quarried near Bilaspur and Seorinarain. Among local industries
the most important is the weaving trade.</p>

<p>The early history of the district is very obscure. From remote
ages it was governed by kings of the Haihai dynasty of Ratanpur
and Raipur, known as the Chhattisgarh rajas, on account of
thirty-six forts (<i>garhs</i>), of which they were the lords. A
genealogical list of kings of this dynasty was carefully kept up to the
fifty-fifth representative in the year 1741, when the country was
seized without a struggle by the Mahrattas of Nagpur. From
1818 to 1830 Bilaspur came under the management of the British
government, the Mahratta chief of Nagpur being then a minor.
In 1854 the country finally lapsed to the British government,
the chief having died without issue. During the Sepoy mutiny
a hill chief of the district gave some trouble, but he was speedily
captured and executed.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BILBAO,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> formerly sometimes written <span class="sc">Bilboa</span>, the capital of
the province of Biscay, in northern Spain; in 43° 15&prime; N. and
2° 45&prime; W.; on the river Nervion on Ansa (in Basque <i>Ibaizabal</i>),
and about 8 m. inland from the Bay of Biscay. Pop. (1900)
83,306. Bilbao is one of the principal seaports of Spain, and
the greatest of Basque towns. It occupies a small but fertile
and beautiful valley, shut in by mountains on every side except
towards the sea, and containing the fortified haven of Portugalete,
the industrial town of Baracaldo (<i>q.v.</i>), and the villages
of Santurce and Las Arenas, where the Nervion broadens to
form the Bay of Bilbao at its mouth. Bilbao comprises two
distinct parts, ancient and modern. The new town lies on the
left bank, while the old town rises on the right in terraces.
Communication across the river is afforded by five bridges,
of which the oldest, San Antonio, is of stone, and dates from the
14th century. The houses in the principal streets are built of
hewn stone, and are several storeys high, with projecting eaves
that give shelter from both sun and rain. Many of the streets
in the old town are very narrow, and have an appearance of
cleanliness and quiet. For a long time no carts or carriages
were permitted to enter the city for fear of polluting and
injuring the pavement, and the transport of goods was carried
on in hand-carts. But after 1876 entirely new districts were
mapped out on the left bank of the Nervion. Fine broad streets,
splendid squares and public gardens, hotels, villas, palatial new
public buildings and numerous schools came into existence.
The part of the town on the right bank is, however, still the great
centre of business, the narrow streets containing the best shops.
There, too, are the banks, the town hall, the theatre, the principal
clubs, and the principal churches, including that of Santiago,
which dates from the 14th century. In and around Bilbao
there are more than thirty convents and monasteries, and at
Olaveaga, about a mile off, is the Jesuit university, attended by
850 students. Public education is not, however, entirely in the
hands of the priesthood and nuns; there are an institute, a normal
school to train teachers, a school of arts and handicrafts, a nautical
school and numerous public primary schools for both sexes.</p>

<p>Few Spanish cities grew so rapidly in size, importance and
wealth as Bilbao in the latter half of the 19th century. Its first
bank was founded in 1857; its first railway (Bilbao-Tudela)
opened in 1863. Thenceforward, despite the check it received
from the Carlist rebellion of 1870-1876, and the contemporaneous
decline of its wool and shipbuilding industries, its prosperity
increased steadily. The population, 17,649 in 1870, rose to
50,734 in 1887, 74,076 in 1897, and 83,306 in 1900. This development
was due principally to the growth of the mining and
metallurgical industries. From a very early period, as the Old
English word <i>bilbo</i>, &ldquo;a sword,&rdquo; attests, Bilbao was celebrated
for the excellent quality of its steel blades; in modern times it
was the natural headquarters of the important steel and iron
trades of the Basque Provinces. Hence it became the centre
of a network of railway lines unsurpassed in Spain. The harbour
works board, constituted in 1877, improved the river channel
and the bar; made wharves and embankments; lighted the
lower reaches of the river by electricity, so as to allow vessels to
enter by night; and constructed a breakwater and counter-mole
outside the bar of the river Nervion, between Santurce, Portugalete
and the opposite headland at the village of Algorta, so as
to secure deep anchorage and easy access to the river. The
first dry dock was constructed in 1896; in 1905 it was supplemented
by another, the largest in Spain. The exports are
chiefly iron; the imports coal; large quantities of wine from
Navarre and the Ebro valley are also sent abroad, and the
importation of timber of all kinds from Scandinavia and Finland,
and coastwise from Asturias, is of great importance. In the
coasting trade the exports are mostly pig-iron, codfish and
some products of local industries and agriculture. The shipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page931" id="page931"></a>931</span>
at Bilbao is mainly Spanish, owing to the multitude of small
vessels employed in the coasting trade; but from 1880 onwards
the majority of foreign ships were British. In 1904, 3319
vessels of 2,267,957 tons were accommodated at Bilbao; more
than 2000 were Spanish and nearly 700 British. In the same
year new harbour works and lighting arrangements were undertaken
on a large scale, and a movement was initiated for the
revival of shipbuilding. Besides the mining and metallurgic
industries, Bilbao has breweries, tanneries, flour mills, glass
works, brandy distilleries, and paper, soap, cotton and mosaic
factories.</p>

<p>Bilbao, or Belvao, as it was often called, was founded by Don
Pedro Lopez de Haro about 1300, and soon rose into importance.
It was occupied by the French in 1795, and from 1808 to 1813;
and in 1835 and 1874 it was unavailingly besieged by the Carlists.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILBEIS,<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Belbes</span>, a town of lower Egypt, on the eastern
arm of the Nile, 36 m. N.N.E. of Cairo by rail. Pop. (1907)
13,485. The Coptic name, Phelbes, seems to have been derived
from Egyptian, but nothing is known of the place before medieval
times. Considered the bulwark of the kingdom on that side,
Bilbeis was by the Moslems defended with strong fortifications.
In 1163-1164 it was besieged for three months by the crusaders
under Amalric, and in 1168 was captured and pillaged by
another army of crusaders. Napoleon in 1798 ordered the
restoration of the fortifications, but they have again fallen into
decay. Bilbeis was the first halting-place of the English cavalry
in their march on Cairo after the fight at Tel-el-Kebir on the
13th of September 1882.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILBERRY,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> <span class="sc">Blaeberry</span> or <span class="sc">Whortleberry</span>, known botanically
as <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> (natural order Ericaceae), a low-growing
shrub, found in woods, copses and on heaths, chiefly
in hilly districts. The stiff stems, from half a foot to two
feet long, bear small ovate leaves with a serrate margin, and
small, globose, rosy flowers tinged with green. The berries are
dark blue, with a waxy bloom, and about one-third of an inch
in diameter; they are used for tarts, preserves, &amp;c. The plant
is widely distributed throughout the north temperate and extends
into the arctic zone. Cowberry is a closely allied species,
<i>V. Vitis-Idaea</i>, growing in similar situations, but not found in the
south-eastern portion of England, distinguished by its evergreen
leaves and red acid berry.</p>

superior temper. In the plural form (as in Shakespeare&rsquo;s phrase
&ldquo;methought I lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes&rdquo;) it
meant the irons into which offenders were put on board ship.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILDERDIJK, WILLEM<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1756-1831), Dutch poet, the son
of an Amsterdam physician, was born on the 7th of September
1756. When he was six years old an accident to his foot
incapacitated him for ten years, and he developed habits of
continuous and concentrated study. His parents were ardent
partisans of the house of Orange, and Bilderdijk grew up with
strong monarchical and Calvinistic convictions. He was, says
Da Costa, &ldquo;anti-revolutionary, anti-Barneveldtian, anti-Loevesteinish,
anti-liberal.&rdquo; After studying at Leiden University,
he obtained his doctorate in law in 1782, and began to
practise as an advocate at the Hague. Three years later he
contracted an unhappy marriage with Rebecca Woesthoven.
He refused in 1795 to take the oath to the new administration,
and was consequently obliged to leave Holland. He went to
Hamburg, and then to London, where his great learning procured
him consideration. There he had as a pupil Katharina Wilhelmina
Schweickhardt (1776-1830), the daughter of a Dutch
painter and herself a poet. When he left London in June 1797
for Braunschweig, this lady followed him, and after he had
formally divorced his first wife (1802) they were married. In
1806 he was persuaded by his friends to return to Holland. He
was kindly received by Louis Napoleon, who made him his
librarian, and a member and eventually president (1809-1811)
of the Royal Institute. After the abdication of Louis Napoleon
he suffered great poverty; on the accession of William of
Orange in 1813 he hoped to be made a professor, but was disappointed
and became a history tutor at Leiden. He continued
his vigorous campaign against liberal ideas to his death, which
took place at Haarlem on the 18th of December 1831.</p>

<p>A picture of the Bilderdijk household is given in the letters
(vol. v., 1850) of Robert Southey, who stayed some time with
Bilderdijk in 1825. Madame Bilderdijk had translated <i>Roderick</i>
into Dutch (1823-1824). For his work as a poet see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dutch
Literature</a></span>. His many-sided activity showed itself also in
historical criticism&mdash;<i>Geschiedenis des Vaderlands</i> (1832-1851,
13 vols.), a conservative commentary on Wagenaar&rsquo;s <i>Vaderlandsche
Historie</i>; in translations from Sophocles (1779 and
1789), of part of the <i>Iliad</i>, of the hymns and epigrams of Callimachus,
and from the Latin poets; in philology&mdash;<i>Taal en
Dichtkundige Verscheidenheden</i> (1820-1825, 4 vols.); and in
drama&mdash;the tragedies, <i>Floris de Vijfde</i> (1808), <i>Willem I. van
Holland</i> (1808), and others. His most important poetical works
are the didactic poem, <i>De Ziekte der geleerden</i> (&ldquo;The Disease of
the Learned&rdquo;), 2 vols., 1807; a descriptive poem in the manner
of Delille in <i>Het Buitenleven</i> (1803); and his fragmentary epic,
<i>De Ondergang der eerste wereld</i> (1820). Other volumes were
<i>Mijne Verlustigung</i> (Leiden, 1781), <i>Bloemtjens</i> (1785), <i>Mengel-poezij</i>
(1799, 2 vols.), <i>Poezij</i> (1803-1807, 4 vols.), <i>Mengelingen</i>

<p><span class="bold">BILFINGER<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Bülffinger</span>), <b>GEORG BERNHARD</b> (1693-1750),
German philosopher, mathematician and statesman, son of
a Lutheran minister, was born on the 23rd of January 1693, at
Kanstatt in Württemberg. As a boy he showed great aptitude
for study, and at first devoted himself to theology, but under the
influence of Wolff&rsquo;s writings he took up mathematics and
philosophy on the lines of Wolff and Leibnitz. Returning to
theology, he attempted to connect it with philosophy in a
treatise, <i>Dilucidationes philosophicae, de deo, anima humana,
mundo</i> (Tübingen, 1725, 1746, 1768). This work, containing
nothing original, but giving a clear representation of Wolff&rsquo;s
philosophy, met with great success, and the author was appointed
to the office of preacher at the castle of Tübingen and of reader in
the school of theology. In 1721, after two years&rsquo; study under
Wolff, he became professor of philosophy at Halle, and in 1724
professor of mathematics. His friends at Tübingen disapproved
his new views, and in 1725, on Wolff&rsquo;s recommendation, he was
invited by Peter the Great to lecture in St Petersburg, where he
was well received. His success in winning the prize of a thousand
crowns offered for a dissertation on the cause of gravity by the
Academy of Sciences of Paris secured his return to his native
land in 1731. In 1735, largely on account of his knowledge of
military engineering, Duke Charles Alexander (1733-1737) made
him a privy councillor, but his hands were tied owing to the
frivolous atmosphere of the court. On the death of the duke,
however, he became a member of the Regency Council, and
devoted himself with energy and success to the reorganization
of the state. In the departments of education, state-religion,
agriculture and commerce, his administration was uniformly
successful, and he became in a real sense the head of the state.
He died at Stuttgart on the 18th of February 1750. After his
return from Russia, he won the highest respect at home and
abroad, and Frederick the Great is recorded to have said of him,
&ldquo;He was a great man whom I shall ever remember with
admiration.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page932" id="page932"></a>932</span></p>

<p>Beside the <i>Dilucidationes</i>, he wrote:&mdash;<i>De harmonia animi et
corporis humani commentatio</i> (Frankfort and Leipzig, 1735;
Tübingen, 1741); <i>De origine et permissione mali</i> (1724), an
account of the Leibnitzian theodicy.</p>

by Bilharz, and hence is generally known as Bilharzia,
though it has been more scientifically named Schistosoma
haematobium. The condition to which it gives rise is that
of bilharziosis. (For description and life history of the parasite
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Trematodes</a></span>.) In man the parasites and ova have
been found in the minute veins of the bladder, ureter and pelvis
of the kidney (more rarely in other organs), where they infest the
mucous and submucous tissues. In an affected bladder the
mucous membrane presents swollen vascular patches of varying
size, or warty prominences on which the urinary salts may be
deposited. The ova often serve as a nucleus for urinary calculi.
Similar changes may take place in the ureter, and the consequent
swelling lead to obstruction to the passage of urine, and if left
untreated to pyelitis and pyonephrosis. If the rectum be affected
the mucous membrane becomes thickened, polypoid growths form
and large submucous haemorrhages may take place.</p>

<p>As to the mode of entrance of this parasite opinion is divided.
Some authorities favour the view that the entrance is through
the skin, urethra or rectum, the result of bathing in infected
water; others that it is taken by the mouth in water or uncooked
fish. The symptoms to which it gives rise are haematuria, pain in
the perineal region and a greater or less degree of anaemia
through loss of blood. If the disease continue, cystitis and its
consequent train of symptoms ensue (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bladder and Prostate
Diseases</a></span>). If the rectum be affected there is considerable
discharge of mucus, and later prolapsus ani may be the result.
But the symptoms vary to a remarkable extent, from the slightest
producing but little discomfort, to the most severe resulting in
death. The liquid extract of male fern is the only drug used with
much success. The symptoms caused by the parasite must be
treated as they arise. Polypoid growths of the rectum must be
surgically treated.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILIN<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (Czech <i>Bilina</i>), a town of Bohemia, Austria, 90 m.
N. of Prague by rail. Pop. (1900) 7871, chiefly German. It
is a very old town situated on the Biela, and contains a
17th-century castle, belonging to Prince Lobkowitz. In the vicinity
of the towns are extensive lignite mines. Bilin is famous for its
mineral springs, the <i>Biliner Sauerbrunnen</i>. They have a temperature
of 45.6° F., and contain a large proportion of bicarbonate
of soda. About 4,000,000 bottles of water are exported annually,
and another article of export is the salt recovered from the water
by evaporation. About 5 m. to the S. of the Sauerbrunnen lies
the Boren or Biliner Stein (1763 ft.), a large mass of phonolite
or clinkstone, with rare flora and fine view. The town is indeed
surrounded by basaltic rocks, the largest of them being the
Radelstein (2460 ft.), from which a fine view is obtained.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILL<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span>. There are three words in English with distinct meanings
and derivations. (1) A written, originally sealed, document.
The word is derived from the Early English <i>bille</i>, Anglo-Latin
<i>billa</i>, from Latin <i>bulla</i>, in the medieval sense of &ldquo;seal.&rdquo; It is
a doublet, therefore, of &ldquo;bull.&rdquo; (2) A common Teutonic word
for a long-handled cutting weapon (O. Eng. <i>bil, billes</i>, sword or
falchion, O. Sax. <i>bill</i>, M.H.G. <i>Bil</i>, Mod. Ger. <i>Bille</i>, a pickaxe;
no connexion with Ger. <i>Beil</i>, an axe), of which the name and
shape is preserved in the hedging-bills used for pruning hedges
and lopping the branches of trees. For an account of the weapon
see (2) below. (3) The beak of a bird. This may be connected
with (2), but it does not appear in any Teutonic language other
than English.</p>

<p>(1) In the sense of a document the word is used in various
connexions in law and commerce.</p>

<p>In the English parliament, and similar legislative bodies, a
bill is a form of statute (<i>q.v.</i>) submitted to either house, which
when finally passed becomes an act. The modern system of
legislating by means of bill and statute appears to have been
introduced in the reign of Henry VI., superseding the older mode
of proceeding by petitions from the Commons, assented to by the
king, and afterwards enrolled by the judges. A bill consists of
a preamble, reciting the necessity for legislation, and clauses
which contain the enactments. (For procedure see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parliament</a></span>.)</p>

<p>A <i>Bill in Chancery</i>, in former days, in English law, was a written
statement of the plaintiff&rsquo;s case whereby he complained of the
wrong upon which the suit was based and prayed for relief. By
the Judicature Acts 1873 and 1875 its place was taken by a
writ and statement of claim (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pleading</a></span>).</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Indictment</i> is a presentment against a prisoner, charging
him with an offence, and presented at quarter sessions or
assizes to the grand jury (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indictment</a></span>).</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Costs</i> is an account setting forth the charges and
disbursements incurred by a solicitor in the conduct of his client&rsquo;s
business. The delivery of a bill of costs is by statute a condition
necessary before the solicitor can sue upon it (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Costs</a></span>).</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Exceptions</i> was formerly a statement in writing of
objections to the ruling of a judge, who, at the trial, had mistaken
the law, either in directing the jury, or in refusing or admitting
evidence or otherwise. The bill of exceptions was tendered at
any time before the verdict by counsel of the dissatisfied party,
who required the judge to seal it. The case proceeded to the jury,
and judgment being given, the point raised was brought before
a court of error. Bills of exceptions were confined to civil cases.
They were abolished by the Judicature Act 1875, and a &ldquo;motion
for a new trial&rdquo; substituted (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Trial</a></span>).</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Health</i> is a document given to the master of a ship by
the consul or other proper authority of the port from which he
clears, describing the sanitary state of the place. A bill of health
may be either &ldquo;clean,&rdquo; &ldquo;suspected&rdquo; or &ldquo;touched,&rdquo; or &ldquo;foul.&rdquo;
A &ldquo;clean&rdquo; bill imports that at the time the ship sailed, no
disease of an infectious or contagious kind is known to exist,
a &ldquo;suspected&rdquo; or &ldquo;touched&rdquo; bill, that no such disease has as
yet appeared, but that there is reason to fear it; a &ldquo;foul&rdquo; bill,
that such a disease actually exists at the time of the ship&rsquo;s
departure. Bills of health are necessary where the destination
of the ship is a country whose laws require the production of
such a bill before the ship is allowed into port, and where, in
default of such production, the ship is subjected to quarantine.</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Mortality</i> in England was a weekly return issued under
the supervision of the company of parish clerks showing the
number of deaths in a parish. During the Tudor period England
suffered much from plague, and various precautionary measures
became necessary. Quarantine or isolation was the most important,
but to carry it out successfully it was necessary to have
early warning of the existence of plague in each parish or house.
For this purpose searchers&mdash;usually women&mdash;were appointed,
who reported to the clerk the cause of each death in the parish.
He, in turn, sent a report to the parish clerks&rsquo; hall, from whence
was issued weekly a return of all the deaths from plague and
other causes in the various parishes, as well as a list of those
parishes which were free from plague. Bills of mortality are
usually said to date from 1538, when parish registers were
established by Cromwell (Lord Essex), but there is extant a bill which
dates from August 1535, and one which is possibly even earlier
than this. It is certain that they first began to be compiled
in a recognized manner in December 1603, and they were continued
regularly from that date down to 1842, when under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page933" id="page933"></a>933</span>
Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836 they were superseded
by the registrar-general&rsquo;s returns. It was not till 1728, when
the <i>ages</i> of the dead were first introduced, that bills of mortality
acquired any considerable statistical value. It was on the data
thus furnished that the science of life insurance was founded.</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Particulars</i> was, in law, a statement in writing,
informing each party to a suit the precise nature of the case they
had to meet. It contained the plaintiff&rsquo;s cause of action or
the defendant&rsquo;s set-off. Particulars are now usually indorsed on
the pleadings (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pleading</a></span>).</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Peace</i> is, in equity, a suit brought by a person to
establish and perpetuate a right which he claims, and which
from its nature may be controverted by different persons at
different times and by different actions; or where several attempts
have already been unsuccessfully made to overthrow the same
right, and justice requires that the party should be quieted in
the right if it is already sufficiently established. Bills of this
nature were usually filed where there was one general right to
be established against a great number of persons, or where one
person claimed or defended a right against many, or where many
claimed or defended a right against one. Thus, a bill might
be filed by a parson for tithes against his parishioners; by
parishioners against a parson to establish a <i>modus</i>; by a lord
against tenants for an encroachment under colour of a common
right; or by tenants against a lord for disturbance of a common
right. Bills were also filed in cases where the plaintiff had, after
repeated and satisfactory trials, established his right at law,
and yet was in danger of further litigation and obstruction to
his right from new attempts to controvert it. Actions in the
nature of bills of peace are still maintainable.</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Sight</i> is a document furnished to a collector of customs
or other proper officer by an importer of goods in England, who,
being unable for want of full information to make a perfect entry
of goods consigned to him, describes the same to the best of his
knowledge and information. The goods may then be provisionally
landed, but perfect entry must be made within three days
by indorsing on the bill of sight the necessary particulars. In
default of perfect entry within three days the goods are taken to
the king&rsquo;s warehouse, and if perfect entry is not made within one
month and all duties and charges paid, they are sold for payment
thereof. See the Customs Consolidation Act 1876.</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Store</i> is a license granted by the custom-house to
re-import British goods into the United Kingdom. All British
goods re-imported into the United Kingdom are entered as
foreign, unless re-imported within ten years after their exportation
and unless the property in the goods continues and remains
in the person by whom they were exported. But in such case
they may be entered as British goods, by bill of store, with the
exception of corn, grain, meal, flour and hops.</p>

<p>A <i>Bill of Victualling</i> or <i>Victualling Bill</i>, in its original meaning,
is a list of all stores for shipment, but now an order from an export
officer of the customs for the shipment from a bonded warehouse
or for drawback of such stores as may be required and allowed
with reference to the number of the crew and passengers on
board a ship proceeding on an oversea voyage. It is made out by
the master and countersigned by the collector of customs. Its
object is to prevent frauds on the revenue. No such stores are
supplied for the use of any ship nor any articles taken on board
deemed to be stores unless they are borne upon the victualling
bill, and any such stores relanded at any place in the United
Kingdom without the sanction of the proper officers of the
customs will be forfeited and the master and owner will each be
liable to a penalty of treble the value of the stores or £100. A
victualling bill serves as a certificate of clearance when there is
nothing but stores on board the ship.</p>

<p>(2) In the sense of a weapon, the primitive forms of a bill
suggest short scythe-blades or hedgers&rsquo; bill-hooks mounted on
tall staves. In such shape it is found in the hands of the English
before the Conquest. English medieval documents make much
confusion between the bill and the halbert and other forms of
staved weapons with cutting heads. Before the 15th century
the bill had been reinforced with a pike head above the curved
blade and another jutting at a right angle from the blade&rsquo;s back.
In this form it became a popular English weapon, the &ldquo;brown
bill&rdquo; of many ballads. Billmen are not found in the king&rsquo;s host
at Crécy and Calais, the bowmen carrying malls or short swords,
and Henry VII.&rsquo;s contracts for troops do not name the bill, which
may be regarded rather as the private man&rsquo;s weapon. But when,
in the middle of the 15th century, Walter Strickland, a Westmorland
squire, contracts to raise armed men, it is noticeable
that more than half his horsemen carry the bill as their chief
arm, while seventy-one bowmen are to march on foot with
seventy-six billmen. In the 16th century the bill, with the
halbert, fell out of use among regular troops, the pike taking their
place on account of the longer staff, which made it a better
defence against cavalry. It remained during the 17th century
as a watchman or constable&rsquo;s weapon, although rudely-fashioned
bills were seen in Sedgemoor fight.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILLAUD-VARENNE, JACQUES NICOLAS<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> (1756-1819),
French revolutionist, was the son of an <i>avocat</i> at the parlement
of Paris. He was badly brought up by a feeble father, a mother
who combined immorality with religion, and a libertine abbé.
At nineteen he donned the robe of an Oratorian, but did not take
the vows, and busied himself with literature rather than with
religion. In 1785 he left the Oratorian college where he was
prefect of studies, came to Paris, married and bought a position
as <i>avocat</i> in the parlement. Early in 1789 he published at
Amsterdam a three-volume work on the <i>Despotisme des ministres
de la France</i>, and he adopted with enthusiasm the principles of
the Revolution.</p>

<p>At the Jacobin club he became from 1790 one of the most
violent of the anti-royalist orators. After the flight of Louis XVI.
to Varennes, he published a pamphlet, <i>L&rsquo;Acéphocratie</i>, in which
he demanded the establishment of a federal republic. On the
1st of July, in a speech at the Jacobin club he spoke of a republic,
and the reference called out the stormy derision of the partisans
of the constitutional monarchy; but repeating his demand for
a republic on the 15th of the same month, the speech was ordered
to be printed and to be sent to the branch societies throughout
France. In the night of the 10th of August 1792 he was
elected one of the &ldquo;deputy-commissioners&rdquo; of the sections who
shortly afterwards became the general council of the commune.
He was accused, though proof is lacking, of having been an
accomplice in the massacres in the prison of the Abbaye. Elected
a deputy of Paris to the National Convention, he at once spoke
in favour of the immediate abolition of the monarchy, and the
next day demanded that all acts be dated from the year 1 of
the republic. At the trial of Louis XVI. he added new charges
to the accusation, proposed to refuse counsel to the king, and
voted for death &ldquo;within 24 hours.&rdquo; On the 2nd of June
1793 he proposed a decree of accusation against the Girondists;
on the 9th, at the Jacobin club, he outlined a programme which
the Convention was destined gradually to realize: the expulsion
of all foreigners not naturalized, the establishment of an impost
on the rich, the deprivation of the rights of citizenship of all
&ldquo;anti-social&rdquo; men, the creation of a revolutionary army, the
licensing of all officers <i>ci-devant</i> nobles, the death penalty for
unsuccessful generals. On the 15th of July he made a violent
speech in the Convention in accusation of the Girondists. Sent
in August as &ldquo;representative on mission&rdquo; to the departments
of the Nord and of Pas-de-Calais, he showed himself inexorable
to all suspects. On his return he was added to the Committee
of Public Safety, which had decreed the arrest <i>en masse</i> of all
suspects and the establishment of a revolutionary army, caused
the extraordinary criminal tribunal to be named officially
&ldquo;Revolutionary Tribunal&rdquo; (on the 29th of October 1793),
demanded the execution of Marie Antoinette and then attacked
Hébert and Danton. Meanwhile he published a book, <i>Les
Éléments du républicanisme</i>, in which he demanded a division
of property, if not equally, at least proportionally among the
citizens. But he became uneasy for his own safety and turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page934" id="page934"></a>934</span>
against Robespierre, whom he attacked on the 8th Thermidor
as a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; and a Dantonist. Surprised and menaced by
the Thermidorian reaction, he denounced its partisans to the
Jacobin club. He was then attacked himself in the Convention
for his cruelty, and a commission was appointed to examine his
conduct and that of some other members of the former Committee
of Public Safety. He was arrested, and as a result of
the insurrection of the 12th Germinal of the year 3 (the 1st of
April 1795), the Convention decreed his immediate deportation
to French Guiana. After the 18th Brumaire he refused the
pardon offered by the First Consul. In 1816 he left Guiana
and took refuge in Port-au-Prince (Haiti), where he died of
dysentery.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1821 were published the <i>Mémoires de Billaud-Varenne écrits
à Port-au-Prince</i> (Paris, 2 vols.), but they are probably forgeries.
An interesting autobiographical sketch of his youth, <i>Tableau du
premier âge</i>, composed in 1786, was published in 1888 in the review,
<i>La Révolution française</i>. The facts of such a life need no comment.

<p><span class="bold">BILLET,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> (1) (Like the Fr. <i>billet</i>, a diminutive of <i>bille</i>, a
writing), a small paper or &ldquo;note,&rdquo; commonly used in the 18th
and early 19th centuries as a &ldquo;billet of invitation.&rdquo; A particular
use of the word in this sense is to denote an order issued to a
soldier entitling him to quarters with a certain person (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#ar67">Billeting</a></span>). From meaning the official order, the word billet
came to be loosely used of the quarters thus obtained, giving
rise to such colloquial expressions as &ldquo;a good billet.&rdquo; Hence
arises the sense of &ldquo;billet&rdquo; as the destination allotted to anything,
for example in the saying of William III. &ldquo;every bullet
has its billet.&rdquo; Another special sense of the word is that of a
voting-paper, found in the 17th century, especially with reference
to the Act of Billets passed by the Scottish parliament
in 1662.</p>

<p>(2) (From the diminutive <i>billette</i> or <i>billot</i> of the Fr. <i>bille</i>, the
trunk of a tree), a piece of wood roughly cylindrical, cut for use
as fuel. In medieval England it was used of the club or bludgeon
which was the weapon proper to the serf (Du Cange, s.
<i>Billus</i>). The name has been transferred to various objects of
a similar shape: to ingots of gold, for example, or bars of iron;
and in heraldry, to a bearing of rectangular shape. The term
is applied in architecture to a form of ornamental moulding
much used in Norman and sometimes in Early English work.
It bears a resemblance to small billets of wood arranged at
regular intervals in a sunk moulding. In French architecture
it is found in early work and there, sometimes, forms the decoration
of a string-course under the gutter, with two or three rows
of billets.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BILLETING,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> the providing of quarters (<i>i.e.</i> board and lodgings)
for soldiers (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Billet</a></span>, 1). Troops have at all times
made use of the shelter and local resources afforded by the
villages on or near their line of march. The historical interest
of billeting in England begins with the repeated petitions against
it in the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I., which
culminated in the Petition of Right. The billeting of troops
was superintended by a civil magistrate of the district to which
the troops were sent or through which they passed. The magistrate,
who acted under an order from the king, too often spared
his friends at the expense of his political or personal opponents.
Owing to the abuses to which the system led, it was declared
illegal by the Petition of Right 1628, and again by an act of
1679. During the reign of James II., however, orders were
frequently issued for billeting, and one of the grievances in the
Bill of Rights was the quartering of soldiers contrary to law.
On the organization of a standing army after the revolution
it was necessary to make legal provision for billeting owing
to the deficiency of barrack accommodation, which sufficed
only for 5000 men. Accordingly, the Mutiny Act 1689 authorized
billeting among the various innkeepers and victuallers
throughout the kingdom. This statute was renewed annually
from 1689 to 1879, when the Army Discipline Act, consolidating
the provisions of the Mutiny Act, was passed. This statute
was replaced by the Army Act 1881 (renewed annually by a
&ldquo;commencement&rdquo; act), which contains the provisions by
which billeting is now regulated. But modern conditions have
practically dispensed with the necessity for billeting; there is
extensive barrack accommodation in most parts of the United
Kingdom, and, moreover, troops are entrained or sent by sea
when the distance to be covered is more than one day&rsquo;s march.
In Scotland the provisions as to billeting were assimilated to
those in England in 1857, and in Ireland in 1879. The Army
(Annual) Act 1909 provided for the billeting of the Territorial
forces in case of national emergency, on occupiers of any kind
of house at the discretion of the chief officer of police.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILLIARDS,<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> an indoor game of skill, played on a rectangular
table,<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and consisting in the driving of small balls with a stick
called a cue either against one another or into pockets according
to the methods and rules described below. The name probably
originated in the Fr. <i>bille</i> (connected with Eng. &ldquo;billet&rdquo;) signifying
a stick. Of the origin of the game comparatively little
is known&mdash;Spain, Italy, France and Germany all being regarded
as its original home by various authorities. In an American
text-book, <i>Modern Billiards</i>, it is stated that Catkire More
(Conn Cetchathach), king of Ireland in the 2nd century, left
behind him &ldquo;fifty-five billiard balls, of brass, with the pools
and cues of the same materials.&rdquo; The same writer refers to the
travels of Anacharsis through Greece, 400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, during which
he saw a game analogous to billiards. French writers differ as
to whether their country can claim its origin, though the name
suggests this. While it is generally asserted that Henrique
Devigne, an artist, who lived in the reign of Charles IX., gave
form and rule to the pastime, the <i>Dictionnaire universel</i> and the
<i>Académie des jeux</i> ascribe its invention to the English. Bouillet
in the first work says: &ldquo;Billiards appear to be derived from
the game of bowls. It was anciently known in England, where,
perhaps, it was invented. It was brought into France by Louis
XIV., whose physician recommended this exercise.&rdquo; In the
other work mentioned we read: &ldquo;It would seem that the game
was invented in England.&rdquo; It was certainly known and played
in France in the time of Louis XI. (1423-1483). Strutt, a rather
doubtful authority, notwithstanding the reputation attained
by his <i>Sports and Pastimes of the People of England</i>, considers it
probable that it was the ancient game of Paille-maille (Pall
Mall) on a table instead of on the ground or floor&mdash;an improvement,
he says, &ldquo;which answered two good purposes: it precluded
the necessity of the player to kneel or stoop exceedingly
when he struck the bowl, and accommodated the game to the
limits of a chamber.&rdquo; Whatever its origin, and whatever the
manner in which it was originally played, it is certain that it
was known in the time of Shakespeare, who makes Cleopatra,
in the absence of Anthony, invite her attendant to join in the
pastime&mdash;</p>

<p>In Cotton&rsquo;s <i>Compleat Gamester</i>, published in 1674, we are told
that this &ldquo;most gentile, cleanly and ingenious game&rdquo; was first
played in Italy, though in another page he mentions Spain as its
birthplace. At that date billiards must have been well enough
known, for we are told that &ldquo;for the excellency of the recreation,
it is much approved of and played by most nations of Europe,
especially in England, there being few towns of note therein
which hath not a public billiard table, neither are they wanting
in many noble and private families in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The game was at one time played on a lawn, like modern
croquet.<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Some authorities consider that in this form it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page935" id="page935"></a>935</span>
introduced into Europe from the Orient by the Crusaders.
The ball was rolled or struck with a mallet or cue (with the latter,
if Strutt&rsquo;s allusion to &ldquo;inconveniences&rdquo; is correct) through hoops
or rings, and these were reproduced for indoor purposes on a
billiard-table, as well as a &ldquo;king&rdquo; or pin which had to be struck.
In the original tables, which were square, there was one pocket,
a hole in the centre of the table, as on a bagatelle board, the
hoop or ring being retained. Then came similar pockets along
one of the side cushions sunk in the bed of the table; and
eventually the modern table was evolved, a true oblong or double-square,
with pockets opening in the cushions at each corner and
in the middle of each long side. The English tables are of this
type, small bags of netting being attached to the pockets. The
French and American game of billiards is played on a pocketless
table. We shall deal first with the English game.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">English Billiards</p>

<p>The English table consists of a framework of mahogany or
other hard wood, with six legs, and strong enough to bear the
weight of five slabs of slate, each 2<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> ft. wide by 6 ft. 1½ in., and
about 2 in. thick. These having been fitted together with the
utmost accuracy to form a level surface, and a green cloth of the
finest texture having been tightly strained over it, the cushions
are screwed on, and the pockets, for which provision has been
made in the slates, are adjusted. As the inside edge of the
cushion is not perpendicular to the bed of the table, but is
bevelled away so that the top overhangs the base by about
¾ of an in., the actual playing area of the table is 6 ft. wide but
is 1½ in. short of 12 ft. long. The height of the table is 2 ft. 8 in.
measured from the floor to the cloth. The cloth is in the shape
shown in the diagram.</p>

D.</p></td></tr></table>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The three spots are on the centre line of the table, and are usually
marked by small circular pieces of black tissue paper or court
plaster; sometimes they are specially marked for the occasion in
chalk. The <i>baulk</i> line and the D are
marked either with chalk, tailors&rsquo; pipeclay,
or an ordinary lead pencil; no other marks
appear on the table. Smaller tables provide
plenty of practice and amusement, provided
that the relation of the length to the
breadth be observed. On these tables full-sized
balls may be used, the pockets being
made slightly smaller than in the full-size
table.</p>

<p>In the early part of the 19th century the
bed of the table was made of wood, occasionally
of marble or stone; green baize was
used to cover both the bed and the cushions,
the latter made of layers of list. Then as
now the cushions proper were glued to a
wooden framework which is screwed on to
the bed of the table. The old list cushions
possessed so little resilience that about 1835
india-rubber was substituted, the value of
the improvement being somewhat modified
by the fact that in cold weather the rubber
became hard and never recovered its elasticity.
Vulcanite resisted the cold, but was
not &ldquo;fast&rdquo; enough, <i>i.e.</i> did not permit the
ball to rebound quickly; but eventually a
substance was invented, practically proof
against cold and sufficiently elastic for
all purposes. Late in the 19th century
pneumatic cushions were tried, tubes into
which air could be pumped, but they did
not become popular, though the so-called
&ldquo; vacuum &ldquo;cushions give good results. The
shape of the face of the cushion has gone through many modifications,
owing to the difficulty experienced in the accurate striking of the
ball when resting against the cushion with only a small fraction of
it&rsquo;s surface offered to the cue; but low cushions are now made which
expose nearly half of the upper part of the ball.</p>

<p>On the size and shape of the pockets depends the ease with which
the players score. The mouth of the pocket, known as the &ldquo;fall&rdquo;
or &ldquo;drop,&rdquo; is part of the arc of a circle, the circle being larger in the
case of the corner pockets than in that of the middle pockets; the
cushions are cut away to admit the passage of the ball. The corner
pockets are measured by the length of the tangent drawn at the outside
point of the arc to the cushion on either side. The middle
pockets are measured at the points where the arc terminates in the
cushions. The fall of the middle pockets, <i>i.e.</i> the outside point of the
arc, is on the line of the outside face of the cushion; that of the corner
pockets is half way down the passage cut in the cushions.</p>

<p>From 1870 to 1885 matches for the championship were played on
&ldquo;Championship Tables,&rdquo; the pockets measuring only 3 in. at the
&ldquo;fall.&rdquo; The tables in ordinary use have 3<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>-in. or 3¾-in. pockets, but
in the &ldquo;Standard Association Tables,&rdquo; introduced by the Billiard
Association at the end of the 19th century, the 3<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>-in. pocket was
adopted for all matches, while the fall of the middle pocket was withdrawn
slightly from the cushion-line. Further, as the shape of the
shoulders of the cushion at the pockets affects the facility of scoring,
the Association adopted a much rounder shoulder than that used
in ordinary tables, thereby requiring greater accuracy on the part
of the player. In the championship tables the baulk line was only
28 in. from the cushion, and the radius of the D was reduced to
9½ and afterwards to 10 in., the spot being 12½ in. from the top
cushion.</p>
</div>

<p>The principal games are three in number,&mdash;<i>billiards proper,
pyramids</i> and <i>pool</i>; and from these spring a variety of others.
The object of the player in each game, however, is either to drive
one or other of the balls into one or other of the pockets, or (only
in billiards proper) to cause the striker&rsquo;s ball to come into successive
contact with two other balls. The former stroke is known
as a <i>hazard</i> (a term derived from the fact that the pockets used to
be called hazards in old days), the latter as a <i>cannon</i>. When
the ball is forced into a pocket the stroke is called a winning
hazard; when the striker&rsquo;s ball falls into a pocket after contact
with the object ball, the stroke is a losing hazard; &ldquo;red hazards&rdquo;
mean that the red ball is the object-ball, &ldquo;white hazards&rdquo; the
white.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Three balls are used in billiards proper, two white and one red.
One of the white balls has a black spot at each end of an imaginary
diameter, to distinguish it from the other, the white balls being
known as spot-white (or &ldquo;spot&rdquo;) and &ldquo;plain.&rdquo; They should be
theoretically perfect spheres, of identical size and weight, and of
equal durability in all parts. The size that is generally used in
matches has a diameter of 2<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> in., and the weight about 4<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> oz. It
is exceedingly difficult to get three such ivory balls (the best substance
for elasticity) except by cutting up many tusks, and when
procured the halls soon lose their perfection, partly because ivory
is softer in one part than another, partly because it is very susceptible
to changes of weather and temperature, and unequally
susceptible in different parts; it is also liable to slight injury in the
ordinary course of play. Various substitutes have, therefore, been
tried for ivory (<i>q.v</i>.), such as crystalate, or bonzoline (a celluloid
compound), and even hollow steel; but their elasticity is inferior
to that of ivory, so that the ball rebounds at a wider angle when
it strikes. The price of a first-rate set of ivory balls is from four to
six guineas; the composition balls cost about half a guinea apiece.</p>

<p>The cue is a rounded rod of seasoned ash about 4 ft. 9 in. in length,
tapering from the butt, which is about 1½ in. in diameter, to the tip,
which varies in size according to the fancy of the player. The
average tip is, however, ½ in. in diameter. The cue weighs generally
between 14 and 18 oz. The tip of the cue is usually a leather cap
or pad, which, being liable to slip along the surface of the ball in
striking, is kept covered with chalk. To the leather tip, the invention
of a Frenchman named Mingin (about 1820), and to the control
which it gives the player over the ball, the science of modern play
is entirely due. The butt of the cue is generally spliced with ebony
or some other heavy wood, since a shaft of plain ash is too light
for its purpose, and is furthermore liable to warp. At one time
it was lawful to use the butt of the cue or even a special instrument
with a squared spoon-shaped end called a mace (or mast), in making
strokes or giving misses, but now all strokes must be made with
the point. The cue is held in one hand, and with the other the
player makes a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; by placing wrist and finger-tips on the
table, and extending his thumb so as to make a passage along which
to slide his cue and to strike the ball. As it is not always possible
to reach the ball in this way, longer cues (the &ldquo;half-butt&rdquo; and
&ldquo;long butt&rdquo;) are required; they are used with a &ldquo;rest,&rdquo; a shaft
of wood at the end of which, perpendicular to the axis, is fastened
an × of wood or metal, the cue being rested on the upper half while
the lower is on the cloth. A &ldquo;long rest,&rdquo; about 6 ft. long, is used
with the long cues, the &ldquo;short rest&rdquo; (or &ldquo;jigger&rdquo;) about 4 ft. long,
with the ordinary cue. A marking-board and stands or racks for
rests and butts, with iron and brush for the table, and a cover for
the table when not in use, complete the billiard &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; of the
room, apart from its seating accommodation.</p>
</div>

<p>The game of <i>billiards proper</i> consists of the making of winning
and losing hazards and cannons. It is usually played between
two opponents (or four, two against two) for 100 or more points,
three being scored for each red hazard, two for each white hazard
and two for each cannon. Certain forfeitures on the other hand
score to the opponent: running your ball off the table or into
a pocket without having hit another ball, 3 (a coup); ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page936" id="page936"></a>936</span>
misses (not hitting an object-ball), 1. All these forfeits involve
the termination of the turn. There are also &ldquo;foul strokes&rdquo;
which score nothing to the opponent, and only involve the
termination of the turn: such as playing with the wrong ball,
forcing a ball off the table, hitting a ball twice, &amp;c. When the
red ball is pocketed it is replaced on the billiard-spot; if that is
occupied, on the pyramid-spot; if that too, on the centre-spot;
but if the opponent&rsquo;s white ball is pocketed it remains out of
play till his turn comes. Public matches between adepts are
played for higher points, but the rules which govern them are
the same. The players have alternate turns, each being &ldquo;in
play&rdquo; and continuing his &ldquo;break&rdquo; until he fails to score.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The game commences by stringing for the lead and choice of balls.
The players standing behind the baulk line, strike each a ball from
the semicircle up to the top cushion, and he whose ball on its return
stops nearest the bottom cushion has the choice of lead and balls.
The red ball is placed on the spot at the commencement of the game,
and the first player must &ldquo;break the balls.&rdquo; The balls are said to
be &ldquo;broken&rdquo; when the first player has struck the red or given a
miss; and the opponent&rsquo;s ball when off the table is said to be &ldquo;in
hand.&rdquo; Breaking the balls thus takes place whenever the position,
as at the beginning of the game, recurs. The first player (or the
player at any stage of the game when he plays after being &ldquo;in
hand&rdquo;) must place his own ball in any part of the D, or on the lines
that form the D, and must play into the part of the table outside
the baulk line, for he may not hit direct any ball that is &ldquo;in baulk,&rdquo;
<i>i.e</i>. on or behind the baulk-line; if he wishes to play at it he must
first strike a cushion out of baulk (or, as it is called, <i>bricole</i>). If a
player fails to score, the adversary plays, as soon as all the balls are at
rest, either from baulk (if &ldquo;in hand&rdquo;) or from the place where his
own ball has stopped. If by the same stroke a player makes two
scores, <i>i.e.</i> a cannon and a hazard for instance, or a winning and a
losing hazard, he scores for each of them. Thus if he pockets the
red ball and the cue-ball, he scores six, or if he makes a cannon
and holes the red ball, five. In the case of a cannon and a losing
hazard, made by the same stroke, the value of the hazard depends
on the ball first struck. Thus if the cue-ball strikes the red, cannons
on to the white, and runs into a pocket, the stroke counts five points,
but only one cannon can be made by the same stroke, even if the
cue-ball strikes each of the others twice. If both object-balls are struck
simultaneously it is considered that the red is struck first. Ten
points are the most that can be scored by a single stroke with the
cue, namely by striking the red ball first and then the white, and
holing all three. If the white ball be struck first and the same series
occurs, the value of the stroke is nine points. When the cue-ball
and object-ball are <i>touching</i>, whatever the position, the red ball is
spotted, the white object-ball put on the centre-spot, and the player
plays from baulk.</p>

<p>There are various subtleties in the art of striking, which may
be indicated, though only practice can really teach them; the simple
stroke being one delivered slightly above the centre of the ball.</p>

<p>The <i>side-stroke</i> is made by striking the object-ball on the side with
the point of the cue. The effect of such a mode of striking the ball
is to make it travel to the right or to the left, according as it is struck,
with a winding or slightly circular motion; and its purpose is to
cause the ball to proceed in a direction more or less slanting than is
usual, or ordinary, when the ball is struck in or about the centre
of its circumference. Many hazards and cannons, quite impossible
to be made with the central stroke, are accomplished with ease and
certainty by the side-stroke. It was the invention of the leather tip
which made <i>side</i> possible. The <i>screw</i>, or twist, is made by striking
the ball low down, with a sharp, sudden blow. According as the ball
is struck nearer and nearer to the cushion, it stops dead at the point
of concussion with the object-ball, or recoils by a series of reverse
revolutions, in the manner familiar to the schoolboy in throwing
forward a hoop, and causing it to return to his hand by the twist
given to its first impetus.</p>

<p>The <i>follow</i> is made by striking the ball high, with a flowing or
following motion of the cue. Just as the low stroke impedes the
motion of the ball, the follow expedites it.</p>

<p>In the <i>drag</i> the ball is struck low without the sudden jerk of the
screw, and with less than the onward push of the follow.</p>

<p>The <i>spot-stroke</i> is a series of winning hazards made by pocketing
the red ball in one of the corners from the spot. The great art is,
first, to make sure of the hazard, and next, to leave the striking ball
in such a position as to enable the player to make a similar stroke
in one or other of the corner pockets. To such perfection was the
spot-stroke brought, that at the end of the 19th century it was
necessary to bar it out of the professional matches, and the
&ldquo;spot-barred&rdquo; game became consequently the rule for all players. The
leading English professionals so completely mastered the difficulties
of the stroke and made such long successions of hazards that they
practically killed all public interest in billiards, the game being little
more than a monotonous series of spot-strokes. In 1888 W.J. Peall
made 633 &ldquo;spots&rdquo; in succession, and in 1890 in a break of 3304&mdash;the
longest record&mdash;no less than 3183 of the points were scored
through spot-stroke breaks. J.G. Sala, by use of the screw-back,
made 186 successive hazards in one pocket, but C. Memmott is said
to have made as many as 423 such strokes in succession. The spot-stroke
was known and used in 1825, when a run of twenty-two
&ldquo;spots&rdquo; caused quite a sensation. The player, whose name was
Carr, offered to play any man in England, but though challenged
by Edwin Kentfield never met him, so the latter became champion.
Kentfield, however, did not regard the spot-stroke as genuine
billiards, rarely played it himself, and had the pocket of his tables
reduced to 3 in., and the billiard-spot moved nearer to the top of
the table, so as to make the stroke exceedingly difficult. John
Roberts, sen., who succeeded Kentfield as champion in 1849, worked
hard at the stroke, but never made, in public, a longer run than 104
in succession. But W. Cook, John Roberts, jun., and others, assisted
by the improvements made in the implements of the game, soon
outdid Roberts, sen., only to be themselves outdone by W. Peall
and W. Mitchell, who made such huge breaks by means of the stroke
that it was finally barred, the Association rules providing that only
two &ldquo;spots&rdquo; may be made in succession unless a cannon is combined
with a hazard, and that after the second hazard the red ball be placed
on the centre-spot.</p>

<p><i>Top-of-the-Table Play.</i>&mdash;When the spot-stroke was dying, many
leading players, headed by John Roberts, jun., assiduously cultivated
another form of rapid scoring, known as &ldquo;top-of-the-table-play,&rdquo; the
first principle of which is to collect the three balls at the top of
the table near the spot. The balls are then manipulated by means of
red winning hazards and cannons, the winning hazard not being
made till the object-white can be left close to the spot.</p>

<p><i>The Push-stroke.</i>&mdash;Long series of cannons were also made along
the edge of the cushion, mainly by means of the &ldquo;push-stroke,&rdquo;
and with great rapidity, but eventually the push-stroke too was
barred as unfair. It was usually employed when cue-ball and
object-ball were very close together and the third ball was in a line,
or nearly in a line with them; then by placing the tip of the cue
very close to the cue-ball and pushing gently and carefully, not
striking, the object-ball could be pushed aside and the cue-ball
directed on ball 3.</p>

<p><i>Balls Jammed in Pockets.</i>&mdash;If the two object-balls get jammed,
either by accident or design, in the jaws of a corner pocket, an
almost interminable series of cannons may be made by a skilful player.
T. Taylor made as many as 729 cannons in 1891, but the American
champion, Frank C. Ives, in a match with John Roberts, jun., easily
beat this in 1893, by making 1267 cannons, before he deliberately
broke up the balls. In Ives&rsquo;s case the balls, however, were just
outside the jaws, which were skilfully used to keep the balls close
together; but in this game, which was a compromise between
English and American billiards, 2¼-in. balls and 3¼-in.
pockets were used. Under the aegis of the Billiard Association a tacit understanding
was arrived at that the position must be broken up, should it
occur. A similar position came into discredit in 1907, in the case of
the &ldquo;cradle-double-kiss&rdquo; or &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; cannon, where the balls
were not actually jammed, but so close on each side of a pocket
that a long series of cannons could be made without disturbing the
position&mdash;a stroke introduced by Lovejoy and carried to extremes
by him, T. Reece and others (see below).</p>

<p><i>The Quill or Feather Stroke.</i>&mdash;This stroke was barred early
in the game&rsquo;s history. It could only be made when the cue-ball was in
hand and the object-ball just outside that part of the baulk-line
that helps to form the D. The cue-ball was set so close to the object-ball
as only not to touch it, and was then pushed very gently into
the pocket, grazing the other so slightly as just to shake it, and
no more. A number of similar strokes could thus be made before
the object-ball was out of position.</p>

<p>A <i>jenny</i> is a losing hazard into one of the (generally top) pockets
when the object-ball is close to the cushion along which the pocket
lies: it requires to be played with the side required to turn the ball
into the pocket. Long jennies to the top pockets are a difficult
and pretty stroke: short jennies are into the middle pockets.</p>

<p><i>Massé and Piqué.</i>&mdash;A <i>massé</i> is a difficult stroke made by striking
downwards on the upper surface of the cue-ball, the cue being held
nearly at right angles to the table, and the point not being directed
towards the centre of the ball. It is generally used to effect a
cannon when the three balls are more or less in a line, the cue-ball
and the object-ball being close together. The term <i>massé</i> is often
used irregularly for <i>piqué</i>, made when the object-ball is as close
to the cue-ball as the latter to the cushion, or the third ball, or to
make screwing impossible; the cue is then raised to an angle of
almost 45° or 50° and its axis directed to the centre of the
cue-ball, so that backward rotation is set up. Vignaux, the French player,
says, &ldquo;<i>Le massé est un piqué</i>.&rdquo; <i>Massé</i> is in fact <i>piqué</i>
combined with side.</p>

<p>The perfection of billiards is to be found in the nice combination
of the various strokes, in such fashion as to leave the balls in a
favourable position after each individual hazard and cannon; and
this perfection can only be attained by the most constant and
unremitting practice. When the cue-ball is so played that its centre
is aimed at the extreme edge of the object-ball, the cue-ball&rsquo;s course
is diverted at what is called the &ldquo;<i>natural</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>half-ball</i>&rdquo; angle.
If the balls were flat discs instead of spheres the edge of one ball
would touch the centre of the other. The object-ball is struck at
&ldquo;three-quarter ball&rdquo; or &ldquo;quarter-ball&rdquo; according as the edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page937" id="page937"></a>937</span>
the cue-ball appears to strike mid-way between the half-ball point
and the centre or edge respectively of the object-ball. The half-ball
angle is regarded as the standard angle for billiards, other
angles being sometimes termed rather vaguely as &ldquo;rather more
or less than half-ball.&rdquo; The angle of the cue-ball&rsquo;s new course
would be about 45°, were the object-ball fixed, but as the object-ball
moves immediately it is struck, the cue-ball is not actually
diverted more than 33° from the prolongation of its original course,
it being conventional among players to regard the prolongation of the
course and not the original track when calculating the angle. The
natural angle, and all angles, may be modified by side and screw;
the use of strength also makes the ball go off at a wider angle.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Development in Billiard Play.</i>&mdash;The modern development of
English billiards is due mainly to the skill of such leading players
as John Roberts, sen., and his son of the same name. Indeed,
their careers form the history of modern billiards from 1849
when the elder Roberts challenged Kentfield (who declined to
play) for the championship. No useful comparison can be made
between the last-named men, and the change of cushions from
list to india-rubber further complicates the question. Kentfield
represented the best of the old style of play, and was a most skilful
performer; but Roberts had a genius for the game, combined
with great nerve and physical power. This capacity for endurance
enabled him to practise single strokes till they became
certainties, when weaker men would have failed from sheer
fatigue; and that process applied to the acquisition of the
spot-stroke was what placed him decisively in front of the
players of his day until a younger generation taught by him
came forward. In 1869 the younger generation had caught him
up, and soon afterwards surpassed him at this stroke; both
W. Cook and J. Roberts, jun., carried it to greater perfection,
but they were in turn put entirely in the shade by W. Mitchell
and W.J. Peall. It is curious to realize that John Roberts,
sen., developed the game chiefly by means of spot-play, whereas
his son continued the process by abandoning it. The public,
however, liked quick scoring and long breaks, and therefore
a substitute had to be devised. This was provided chiefly by
the younger Roberts, whose fertility of resource and manual
dexterity eventually placed him by a very long way at the head
of his profession. In exhibition matches he barred the spot-stroke
and gave his attention chiefly to top-of-the-table play.</p>

<p>The next development was borrowed from the French game
(see below), which consists entirely of cannons. Both French
and American professors, giving undivided attention to cannons
and not being permitted to use the <i>push-stroke</i>, arrived at a
perfection in controlling or &ldquo;<i>nursing</i>&rdquo; the balls to which
English players could not pretend; yet the principles involved
in making a long series of cannons were applied, and leading
professionals soon acquired the necessary delicacy of touch.
The plan is to get the three balls close to each other, say within
a space which a hand can cover, and not more than from
4 to 8 in. from a cushion. The striker&rsquo;s ball should be
behind the other two, one of which is nearer the cushion, the
other a little farther off and farther forward. The striker&rsquo;s ball
is tapped quietly on the one next the cushion, and hits the third
ball so as to drive it an inch or two in a line parallel to the
cushion. The ball first struck rebounds from the cushion, and
at the close of the stroke all three balls are at rest in a position
exactly similar to that at starting, which is called by the French
<i>position mère</i>. Thus each stroke is a repetition of the previous one,
the positions of the balls being relatively the same, but actually
forming a series of short advances along the cushion. With the
push-stroke a great number of these cannons could be quickly
made, say 50 in 3½ minutes; and, as that means 100 points,
scoring was rapid. Most of the great spot-barred breaks contained
long series of these cannons, and their value as records
is correspondingly diminished, for in such hair&rsquo;s-breadth distances
very often no one but the player, and sometimes not
even he, could tell whether a stroke was made or missed or was
foul. Push-barred, the cannons are played nearly as fast;
but with most men the series is shorter, <i>massé</i> strokes being used
when the cannon cannot be directly played.</p>

<p><i>Championship.</i>&mdash;When Kentfield declined to play in 1849,
John Roberts, sen., assumed the title, and held the position till
1870, when he was defeated by his pupil W. Cook. The following
table gives particulars of championship matches up to 1885:&mdash;</p>

<p>These games were played on three-inch-pocket tables, and
John Roberts, jun., fairly contended that he remained champion
till beaten on such a table under the rules in force when he won
the title or under a new code to which he was a consenting
party. A match was played for the championship between
Roberts and Dawson, in 1899 of 18,000 up, level. The main
departure from a championship game lay in the table, which
had ordinary, though not easy pockets, instead of three-inch
pockets. The match excited much interest, because Dawson,
who had already beaten North for the Billiard Association
championship, was the first man for many years to play
Roberts even; but Roberts secured the game by 1814 points.
After this Dawson improved materially, and in 1899, for the
second time, he won the Billiard Association championship.
His position was challenged by Diggle and Stevenson, who
contested a game of 9000 points. Stevenson won by 2900, but
lost to Dawson by 2225 points; he beat him in January 1901,
and though Dawson won a match before the close of the spring,
Stevenson continued to establish his superiority, and at the
beginning of 1907 was incontestably the English champion.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Records.</i>&mdash;Record scores at billiards have greatly altered since
W. Cook&rsquo;s break of 936, which included 292 spots, and was made
in 1873. Big breaks are in some degree a measure of development;
but too much weight must not be given to them, for tables vary
considerably between easy and difficult ones, and comparisons are
apt to mislead. Peall&rsquo;s break of 3304 (1890) is the largest &ldquo;all-in&rdquo;
score on record; and in the modern spot-barred and push-barred
game with a championship table, H.W. Stevenson in April 1904
made 788 against C. Dawson. In January 1905 John Roberts,
however, made 821 in fifty minutes, in a match with J. Duncan,
champion of Ireland; but this was not strictly a &ldquo;record,&rdquo; since
the table had not been measured officially by the Billiard Association.
A break of 985 was made by Diggle in 1895 against Roberts, on a
&ldquo;standard table&rdquo; (before the reduction in size of the pockets). On
the 5th of March 1907 T. Reece began beating records by means of
the &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; stroke, making 1269 (521 cannons), and he made
an unfinished 4593 with the same stroke (2268 cannons) on the
23rd of March. Further large breaks followed, including 23,769
by Dawson on the 20th of April 1907, and even more by Reece;
and towards the end of the year the Billiard Association ruled the
stroke out.</p>

<p><i>Handicapping.</i>&mdash;The obvious way of handicapping unequal
players is for the stronger player to allow his opponent an agreed
number of points by way of start. Or he may &ldquo;owe&rdquo; points, <i>i.e.</i>
not begin to reckon his score till he has scored a certain number.
A good plan is for the better player to agree to count no breaks that
are below a certain figure. The giver of points scores all forfeits
for misses, &amp;c. If A can give B 20 points, and B can give C 25 points,
the number of points that A can give C is calculated on the following
formula,</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">20 + 25 &minus;</td> <td>20 × 25</td>
<td rowspan="2">= 40.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">100</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">The handicap of &ldquo;barring&rdquo; one
or more pockets to the better player, he having only four or five
sockets to play into, has been abolished in company with other
methods that tended to make the game tedious.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Pyramids</i> is played by two or four persons&mdash;in the latter case
in sides, two and two. It is played with fifteen balls, placed
close together by means of a frame in the form of a triangle or
pyramid, with the apex towards the player, and a white striking
ball. The centre of the apex ball covers the second or pyramid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page938" id="page938"></a>938</span>
spot, and the balls forming the pyramid should lie in a compact
mass, the base in a straight line with the cushion.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Pyramids is a game entirely of winning hazards, and he who
succeeds in pocketing the greatest number of balls wins. Usually
the pyramid is made of fifteen red or coloured balls, with the striking
ball white. This white ball is common to both players. Having
decided on the lead, the first player, placing his ball in the
baulk-semicircle, strikes it up to the pyramid, with a view either to lodge
a ball in a pocket or to get the white safely back into baulk. Should
he fail to pocket a red ball, the other player goes on and strikes the
white ball from the place at which it stopped. When either succeeds
in making a winning hazard, he plays at any other ball he chooses,
and continues his break till he ceases to score; and so the game is
continued by alternate breaks until the last red ball is pocketed.
The game is commonly played for a stake upon the whole, and a
proportionate sum upon each ball or life&mdash;as, for instance, 3s. game
and 1s. balls. The player wins a life by pocketing a red ball or forcing
it over the table; and loses a life by running his own, the white, ball
into a pocket, missing the red balls, or intentionally giving a miss.
In this game the baulk is no protection; that is to say, the player
can pocket any ball wherever it lies, either within or without the
baulk line, and whether the white be in hand or not. This liberty
is a great and certain advantage under many circumstances, especially
in the hands of a good player. It is not a very uncommon
occurrence for an adept to pocket six or eight balls in a single break.
Both Cook and Roberts have been known, indeed, to pocket the
whole fifteen. If four persons play at pyramids, the rotation is
decided by chance, and each plays alternately&mdash;partners, as in
billiards, being allowed to advise each other, each going on and continuing
to play as long as he can, and ceasing when he misses a
hazard. Foul strokes are reckoned as in billiards, except as regards
balls touching each other. If two balls touch, the player proceeds
with his game and scores a point for every winning hazard. When
all the red balls but one are pocketed, he who made the last hazard
plays with the white and his opponent with the red; and so on
alternately, till the game terminates by the holing of one or other
ball. The pyramid balls are usually a little smaller than the billiard
balls; the former are about 2 in. in diameter, the latter 2<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> in. to
2<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in.</p>

<p><i>Losing Pyramids</i>, seldom played, is the reverse of the last-named
game, and consists of losing hazards, each player using the same
striking ball, and taking a ball from the pyramid for every losing
hazard. As in the other game, the baulk is no protection. Another
variety of pyramids is known as <i>Shell-out</i>, a game at which any
number of persons may play. The pyramid is formed as before, and
the company play in rotation. For each winning hazard the striker
receives from each player a small stake, and for each losing hazard
he pays a like sum, till the game is concluded, by pocketing the
white or the last coloured ball.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Pool</i>, a game which may be played by two or more persons,
consists entirely of winning hazards. Each player subscribes a
certain stake to form the pool, and at starting has three chances
or lives. He is then provided with a coloured or numbered ball,
and the game commences thus:&mdash;The white ball is placed on the
spot and the red is played at it from the baulk semicircle. If
the player pocket the white he receives the price of a life from
the owner of the white; but if he fail, the next player, the yellow,
plays on the red; and so on alternately till all have played, or
till a ball be pocketed. When a ball is pocketed the striker plays
on the ball nearest his own, and goes on playing as long as he
can score.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The order of play is usually as follows:&mdash;The white ball is spotted;
red plays upon white; yellow upon red; then blue, brown, green,
black, and spot-white follow in the order of succession named, white
playing on spot-white. The order is similar for a larger number,
but it is not common for more than seven or eight to join in a pool.
The player <i>wins</i> a life for every ball pocketed, and receives the sum
agreed on for each life from the owner of that ball. He <i>loses</i> a life
to the owner of the ball he plays on and misses; or by making a
losing hazard after striking such ball; by playing at the wrong ball,
by running a coup; or by forcing his ball over the table. Rules
governing the game provide for many other incidents. A ball in
baulk may be played at by the striker whose ball is in hand. If
the striker&rsquo;s ball be angled&mdash;that is, so placed in the jaws of the
pocket as not to allow him to strike the previously-played ball&mdash;he
may have all the balls except his own and the object ball removed
from the table to allow him to try bricole from the cushion. In some
clubs and public rooms an angled ball is allowed to be moved an inch
or two from the corner; but with a ball so removed the player must
not take a life. When the striker loses a life, the next in rotation
plays at the ball nearest his own; but if the player&rsquo;s ball happen
to be in hand, he plays at the ball nearest to the centre spot on the
baulk line, whether it be in or out of baulk. In such a case the striker
can play from any part of the semicircle. Any ball lying in the way
of the striker&rsquo;s ball, and preventing him from taking fair aim and
reaching the object-ball, must be removed, and replaced after the
stroke. If there be any doubt as to the nearest ball, the distance
must be measured by the marker or umpire; and if the distance be
equal, the ball to be played upon must be decided by chance. If the
striker first pocket the ball he plays on and then runs his own into
a pocket, he loses a life to the player whose ball he pocketed, which
ball is then to be considered in hand. The first player who loses
all his three lives can &ldquo;star&rdquo;; that is, by paying into the pool a
sum equal to his original stake, he is entitled to as many lives as
the lowest number on the marking board. Thus if the lowest
number be 2, he stars 2; if 1, he stars 1. Only one star is allowed
in a pool; and when there are only two players left in, no star can
be purchased. The price of each life must be paid by the player
losing it, immediately after the stroke is made; and the stake or
pool is finally won by the player who remains longest in the game.
In the event, however, of the two players last left in the pool having
an equal number of lives, they may either play for the whole or divide
the stake. The latter, the usual course, is followed except when the
combatants agree to play out the game. When three players are
left, each with one life, and the striker makes a miss, the two remaining
divide the pool without a stroke&mdash;this rule being intended to
meet the possible case of two players combining to take advantage
of a third. When the striker has to play, he may ask which ball he
has to play at, and if being wrongly informed he play at the wrong
ball, he does not lose a life. In clubs and public rooms it is usual
for the marker to call the order and rotation of play: &ldquo;Red upon
white, and yellow&rsquo;s your player&rdquo;; and when a ball has been pocketed
the fact is notified&mdash;&ldquo;Brown upon blue, and green&rsquo;s your player, in
hand&rdquo;; and so on till there are only two or three players left in the
pool.</p>

<p>There are some varieties of the game which need brief mention.</p>

<p><i>Single Pool</i> is the white winning hazard game, played for a stake
and so much for each of three or more lives. Each person has a
ball, usually white and spot-white. The white is spotted, and the
other plays on it from the baulk-semicircle; and then each plays
alternately, spotting this ball after making a hazard. For each
winning hazard the striker receives a life; for each losing hazard he
pays a life; and the taker of the three lives wins the game. No star
is allowed in single pool. The rules regulating pool are observed.</p>

<p><i>Nearest-Ball Pool</i> is played by any number of persons with the
ordinary coloured balls, and in the same order of succession. All
the rules of pool are followed, except that the baulk <i>is</i> a protection.
The white is spotted, and the red plays on it; after that each striker
plays upon the ball nearest the upper or outer side of the baulk-line;
but if the balls lie within the baulk-line, and the striker&rsquo;s ball be in
hand, he must play up to the top cushion, or place his ball on the spot.
If his ball be not in hand, he plays at the nearest ball, wherever it
may lie.</p>

<p><i>Black Pool.</i>&mdash;In this game, which lasts for half-an-hour, there are
no lives, the player whose ball is pocketed paying the stake to the
pocketer. Each player receives a coloured ball and plays in order
as in &ldquo;Following Pool,&rdquo; the white ball being spotted; there is, in
addition, however, a black ball, which is spotted on the centre-spot.
When a player has taken a life he may&mdash;in some rooms and clubs
<i>must</i>&mdash;play on the black ball. If he pockets it he receives a stake
from each player, paying a stake all round if he misses it, or commits
any of the errors for which he would have to pay at &ldquo;Following
Pool.&rdquo; The black ball cannot be taken in consecutive strokes.
Sometimes a pink ball, spotted on the pyramid spot, is added and
a single stake is paid all round to the man who pockets it, and a
double stake on the black; it is also permitted in some rooms to
take blacks and pinks alternately without pocketing a coloured
ball between the strokes. Again it is the custom in certain rooms
to let a player, after the first round, play on any ball. The game
is more amusing when as much freedom is allowed as possible,
so that the taking of lives may be frequent. At the end of the half-hour
the marker announces at the beginning of the round that it
is the last round. White, who lost a stroke at the beginning by
being spotted, has the last stroke. If a player wishes to enter the
game during its progress his ball is put on the billiard-spot just before
white plays, and he takes his first stroke at the end of the round.</p>

<p><i>Snooker Pool.</i>&mdash;This is a game of many and elaborate rules. In
principle it is a combination of pyramids and pool. The white ball
is the cue-ball for all players. The pyramid balls, set up as in pyramids,
count one point each, the yellow ball two points, green ball
three, and so on. The black is put on the billiard-spot, the pink on
the centre-spot, blue below the apex ball of the pyramid; brown,
green and yellow on the diameter of the semicircle, brown on the
middle spot, green on the right corner spot of the D, yellow on the
left. The players, having decided the order of play, generally by
distributing the pool balls from the basket, and playing in the order
of colours as shown on the marking board, are obliged to strike a
red ball first. If it is pocketed, the player scores one and is at
liberty to play on any of the coloured balls; though in some clubs
he is compelled to play on the yellow. If he pockets a coloured ball
he scores the number of points which that ball is worth, and plays
again on a red ball, the coloured ball being replaced on its spot, and
so on; but a red ball must always be pocketed before a more valuable
ball can be played at. When all the red balls have been pocketed&mdash;none
are put back on the table as at pyramids&mdash;the remaining balls
<i>must</i> be pocketed in the pool order and are not replaced. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page939" id="page939"></a>939</span>
penalties for missing a ball, running into a pocket, &amp;c., are deducted
from the player&rsquo;s score; they correspond to the values of the balls,
one point if the red be missed, two if the yellow be missed, &amp;c. If,
before hitting the proper ball, the player hits one of a higher value,
the value of that ball is deducted from his score, but there is no
further penalty. A player is &ldquo;snookered&rdquo; if his ball is so placed
that he cannot hit a ball on which he is compelled to play. In this
case he is allowed in some rooms to give a miss, but in such a way
that the next player is not snookered; in others he must make a
<i>bona fide</i> attempt to hit the proper ball off the cushion, being liable
to the usual penalty if in so doing he hits a ball of higher value. In
some rooms it is considered fair and part of the game to snooker an
opponent deliberately; in others the practice is condemned. The
rules are so variable in different places that even the printed rules
are not of much value, owing to local by-laws.</p>

<p>Among other games of minor importance, being played in a less
serious spirit than those mentioned, are <i>Selling Pool, Nearest Ball
Pool, Cork Pool</i> and <i>Skittle Pool</i>. The directions for playing them
may be found in <i>Billiards</i> (Badminton Library series).</p>
</div>

<p><i>French and American Billiards.</i>&mdash;French and American
billiards is played on a pocketless table, the only kind of table
that is used in France, though the English table with six pockets
is also occasionally to be found in America. For match purposes
the table used measures 10 ft. by 5 ft., but in private houses and
clubs 9 ft. by 4¼ ft. is the usual size, while tables 8 ft. by 4 ft.
are not uncommon. The balls, three in number as in English
billiards, measure from 2¼ to 2<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in., the latter being &ldquo;match&rdquo;
size. Since they are both larger and heavier than the English
balls, the cues are somewhat heavier and more powerful, so that
better effects can be produced by means of &ldquo;side,&rdquo; masses, &amp;c.
Only cannons (called in America &ldquo;caroms,&rdquo; in French <i>caramboles</i>)
are played, each counting one point.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The three-ball carom game is the recognized form of American
billiards. The table is marked with a centre-spot, &ldquo;red&rdquo; spot and
&ldquo;white&rdquo; spot. The first is on the centre of an imaginary line
dividing the table longitudinally into halves; the red (for the red
ball) and white spots are on the same line, half-way between the
centre-spot and the end cushions, the white spot being on the
string-line (corresponding to the English baulk-line). The right to
play first is decided, as in England, by &ldquo;stringing.&rdquo; The opponent&rsquo;s
white ball and the red ball being spotted, the player plays from
within the imaginary baulk-line. Each carom counts one point;
a miss counts one to the opponent. A ball is re-spotted on its proper
spot if it has been forced off the table. Should red be forced off the
table and the red spot be occupied, it is placed on the white spot.
White under similar conditions is set on the red spot. The centre
spot is only used when, a ball having been forced off the table, both
spots are occupied. If a carom be made, and the ball afterwards
jumps off the table, it is spotted and the count allowed. If the
striker moves a ball not his own before he strikes, he cannot count
but may play for safety. If he does so after making a carom the
carom does not count, he forfeits one, and his break is ended. If
he touches his own ball before he plays, he forfeits a point, and
cannot play the stroke. Should he, however, touch his ball a
second time, the opponent has the option of having the balls replaced
as exactly as possible, or of playing on them as they are left. It is
a foul stroke to play with the wrong ball, but if the offence is not
detected before a second stroke has been made, the player may
continue.</p>

<p>Such long runs of caroms, chiefly &ldquo;on the rail&rdquo; along the cushion,
have been made by professional players (H. Kerkau, the German
champion, making 7156 caroms in 1901 at Zürich), that various
schemes have been devised to make the game more difficult. One
of these is known as the &ldquo;continuous baulk-line.&rdquo; Lines are drawn,
8, 14, 18 or even 22 in. from the rails, parallel to the side of the table,
forming with them eight compartments. Of these 14 and 18 are the
most general. Only one, two or three caroms, as previously arranged,
are allowed to be made in every space, unless one at least of the
object-balls is driven over a line. In the space left in the middle
of the table any number of caroms may be made without restriction.
In the case of the <i>Triangular Baulk-line</i>, lines are drawn at the four
corners from the second &ldquo;sight&rdquo; on the side-rails to the first sight
on the end-rails, forming four triangles within which only a limited
number of caroms may be made, unless one object-ball at least be
driven outside one of the lines. The <i>Anchor Baulk-lines</i> were devised
to checkmate the &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; shot, which consisted in getting the
object-balls on the rail, one on either side of a baulk-line, and
delicately manipulating them so as to make long series of caroms;
each ball being in a different compartment, neither had to be driven
over a line. The &ldquo;anchor baulk-lines&rdquo; form a tiny compartment,
6 in. by 3, and are drawn at the end of a baulk-line where it touches
the rail and so divides the compartment into two squares. Only
one shot is allowed in this &ldquo;anchor-space,&rdquo; unless a ball be driven
out of it. By these methods, &ldquo;crotching&rdquo; (getting them jammed
in a corner) the balls, and long series of rail-caroms were abolished.
The push-stroke is strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>The <i>Cushion Carom</i> game is a variety of the ordinary three-ball
game, in which no carom counts unless the cue-ball touches a cushion
before the carom is completed. There is also <i>Three-Cushion Carom</i>,
which is explained by its title, and the <i>Bank-Shot</i> game, in which
the cue-ball must touch a cushion before it strikes either ball. The
cushion carom games are often used in handicapping, other methods
of which are for the better player to make a certain number of caroms
&ldquo;or no count,&rdquo; and for the weaker to receive a number of points
in the game.</p>

<p>In France billiards was played exclusively by the aristocracy
and the richer middle class until the first part of the 17th century,
when the privilege of keeping billiard-rooms was accorded to the
<i>billardiers paulmiers</i>, and billiards became the principal betting
game and remained so until the time of Louis Philippe. The most
prominent French player of late years is Maurice Vignaux. The
French game became the accepted one in the United States about
1870, and the best American players have proved themselves superior
to the French masters with the exception of Vignaux. The best-known
American masters have been M. Daly, Shaafer, Slosson,
Carter, Sexton and Frank C. Ives, doubtless the most brilliant player
who ever lived. His record for the 18-in. baulk-line game was an
average of 50, with a high run of 290 points. In cushion-caroms
he scored a run of 85.</p>

<p>The four-ball game, the original form of American billiards, is
practically obsolete. It was formerly played on an English six-pocket
table, with a dark-red and a light-red ball and two white
ones. At present when played an ordinary table is used, the rules
being identical with those of the three-ball game.</p>

<p><i>Pool</i> is played in America on a six-pocket table with fifteen balls,
each bearing a number. There are several varieties of the game, the
most popular being <i>Continuous Pool</i>, an expanded form of <i>Fifteen-Ball
Pool</i>, in which the balls are set up as in English pyramids, the
game being won by the player pocketing the majority of the fifteen
balls, each ball counting one point, the numbers being used only to
distinguish them, as a player must always name, or &ldquo;call,&rdquo; the ball
he intends to pocket and the pocket into which he will drive it.
The player who &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; (plays first) must send at least two balls
to the cushion or forfeit three points. The usual method is to strike
a corner ball just hard enough to do this but not hard enough to
break up the balls, as in that case the second player would have too
great an advantage. Balls pocketed by chance in the same play in
which a called ball has been legitimately put down are counted;
all others pocketed by accident are replaced on the table. In
Fifteen-Ball Pool each frame (fifteen balls) constitutes a game. In
Continuous Pool the game is for a series of points, generally 100,
the balls being set up again after each frame and the player pocketing
the last ball having the choice whether to break or cause his opponent to do so.</p>

<p>The balls in Fifteen-Ball Pool are generally all of one colour,
usually red. In <i>Pyramid Pool</i> they are parti-coloured as well
as numbered, and the game, which usually consists of a single frame,
is won by the player who, when all fifteen balls have been pocketed,
has scored the greatest aggregate of the numbers on the balls. In
<i>Chicago Pool</i> each frame constitutes a game and is won by the player
scoring the highest aggregate of numbers on the balls, which are set
up round the cushion opposite the diamond sights, the 1 being
placed in the middle of the top cushion, opposite the player,
with the odd-numbered balls on the player&rsquo;s left and those with even
numbers on his right. The arrangement of the balls, however,
varies and is not important. Each player must strike the
lowest-numbered ball still on the table, forfeiting the number of points
represented by the ball should his ball first hit any other ball, or
should he pocket his own ball. If he pockets the proper ball all
others that fall into pockets on that play count for him also. Missing
the ball played at forfeits three points (sometimes the number on
the ball played at), as well as fouls of all kinds. <i>Bottle Pool</i> is played
with a cue-ball, the 1 and 2 pool-balls and the leather pool-bottle,
which is stood upon its mouth in the middle of the table. A carom
on two balls counts 2 points; pocketing the 1-ball counts 1;
pocketing the 2-ball counts 2; upsetting bottle from carom counts
5; upsetting bottle to standing position counts 10, or, in many
clubs, the game is won when this occurs. Otherwise the game is for
31 points, which number must be scored exactly, a player scoring
more than that number being &ldquo;burst,&rdquo; and having to begin over
again. There are many penalties of one point, such as missing the
object-ball, foul strokes, forcing a ball or the bottle off the table,
pocketing one&rsquo;s own ball and upsetting the bottle without hitting
a ball. The game of <i>Thirty-Four</i> is played without a bottle, the
scoring being by caroms or pocketing the two object-balls. Exactly
34 must be scored or the player is &ldquo;burst.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>High-Low-Jack-Game</i> is played with a set of pyramid balls by
any number of players, the order of starting being determined by
distributing the small balls from the pool-bottle. The 15-ball is
High, the 1 Low, the 9 Jack, and the highest aggregate of numbers
is the game, each of these four counting one point, the game consisting
of seven points, and therefore lasting at least for two frames. The
balls are set up with the three counting balls in the centre and
broken as in pyramids, although balls accidentally falling into
pockets count for the player, on which account the balls are sometimes
broken as violently as possible. When two or more players
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page940" id="page940"></a>940</span>
have the same score the High ball wins before the Low, &amp;c., as in
the card game of the same title.</p>

<p><i>Pin Pool</i> is played with two white balls, one red and five small
pins set up in diamond form in the centre of the table with the pin
counting 5 (the king-pin) in the middle, the pins being 3 in. apart.
Each player is given a small ball from the bottle and this he keeps
secret until he is able to announce that his points, added to the
number on his small ball, amount to exactly 31. If he &ldquo;bursts&rdquo;
he must begin again. Points are made only by knocking down pins,
which are numbered 1 to 5. Should a player knock down with one
stroke all four outside pins, leaving the 5-pin-standing, it is a
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; and he wins the game.</p>

<p>Besides these common varieties of pool there are many others
which are played in different parts of America, many of them local
in character.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The scientific features of billiards have been
discussed at more or less length in several of the following older
works:&mdash;E. White, <i>Practical Treatise on the Game of Billiards</i> (1807),
this was partly a translation of a French treatise, published in 1805,
and partly a compilation from the article in the <i>Académie universelle
des jeux</i>, issued in the same year, and since frequently re-edited and
reprinted; <i>Le Musée des jeux</i> (Paris, 1820); Monsieur Mingaud,
<i>The Noble Game of Billiards</i> (Paris, 1834); a translation of the same,

Billiards</i> (1868); Fred. Hardy, <i>Practical Billiards</i>, edited by W.

authorities as the following:&mdash;J. Roberts, <i>The Game of Billiards</i>

<p><span class="bold">BILLINGTON, ELIZABETH<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (1768?-1818), British opera-singer,
was born in London, her father being a German musician named
Weichsel, and her mother a popular vocalist. She was trained
in music, and at fourteen sang at a concert in Oxford. In 1783
she married James Billington, a double-bass player. She had
a voice of unusual compass, and as Rosetta in <i>Love in a Village</i>
she had a great success at Covent Garden in 1786, being engaged
for the season at a salary of £1000, a large sum for those days.
Her position as a singer in London was now assured. In 1794
she and her husband went to Italy, and Mrs Billington appeared
at Naples (where she was the heroine of a new opera, <i>Inez di
Castro</i>, written for her by F. Bianchi), at Florence, at Venice
and at Milan. Her husband died suddenly during the tour, and
in 1799 she married a Frenchman named Felissent, whom, however,
she left in 1801. Returning to England she appeared
alternately at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, her professional
income during 1801 amounting to between £10,000 and £15,000.
Henceforward she sang in Italian opera till the end of 1810,
when ill-health forced her to abandon her profession. In 1817
she was reconciled to her husband, and went with him to live
near Venice, where she died on the 25th of August 1818.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILLITON<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (Dutch <i>Blitoeng</i>), an island of the Dutch East
Indies, between Banka and Borneo, from which it is separated
respectively by Caspar and Karimata straits. Politically it is
under an assistant resident. It is roughly circular in form, its
extreme measurements being 55 m. by 43, and its area 1773
sq. m. In physical structure and in products it resembles
Banka; its coasts are sandy or marshy; in the interior an
extreme elevation of 1670 ft. is found. The geological formation
is Devonian and granitic, with laterites. The mean annual rainfall
is heavy, 102 to 126 in. The day temperature varies from
80° to 87° Fahr. The nights are very cool. Like Banka, Billiton
is chiefly noted for its production of tin, the island forming the
southern limit of the occurrence of this metal in this locality.
There are upwards of 80 mines, which employ some 7500 workmen,
and have produced more than 6500 tons of tin in a year.
Iron is also worked. On the rocks along the coast are found
tortoises, trepang and edible birds&rsquo; nests, which are articles
of export. The forests supply wood of different kinds for
boat-building, in which the inhabitants are expert; and also provide
trade in cocoa-nuts, sago, gum and other produce. The population
is about 42,000, of whom some 12,000 are Chinese. The natives
belong to two classes, the <i>Orang Darat</i>, the aborigines, thought
to be akin to the Battas and other branches of the pre-Malayan
or Indonesian race; and the <i>Orang Sekah</i>, people of Malayan
stock who live in boats. The coast is as a rule difficult of access,
being beset with rocks and coral banks, and the best harbour
is that at the chief town of Tanjong Pandan on the west coast.
The island was formerly under the sultan of Palembang, by
whom it was ceded to the British in 1812. As no mention was
made of it in the treaty between the British and Dutch in 1814,
the former at first refused to renounce their possession, and only
recognized the Dutch claim in 1824. Till 1852 Billiton was
dependent on Banka.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BILL OF EXCHANGE,<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> a form of negotiable instrument,
defined below, the history of which, though somewhat obscure,
was ably summed up by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in his
judgment in <i>Goodwinn</i> v. <i>Robarts</i> (1875), L.R. 10 Ex. pp. 346-358.
Bills of exchange were probably invented by Florentine Jews.
They were well known in England in the middle ages, though
there is no reported decision on a bill of exchange before the year
1603. At first their use seems to have been confined to foreign
bills between English and foreign merchants. It was afterwards
extended to domestic bills between traders, and finally to
bills of all persons, whether traders or not. But for some time
after they had come into general employment, bills were always
alleged in legal proceedings to be drawn <i>secundum usum et
consuetudinem mercatorum</i>. The foundations of modern English
law were laid by Lord Mansfield with the aid of juries of London
merchants. No better tribunal of commerce could have been
devised. Subsequent judicial decisions have developed and
systematized the principles thus laid down. Promissory notes
are of more modern origin than bills of exchange, and their
validity as negotiable instruments was doubtful until it was
confirmed by a statute of Anne (1704). Cheques are the creation
of the modern system of banking.</p>

<p>Before 1882 the English law was to be found in 17 statutes
dealing with isolated points, and about 2600 cases scattered
over some 300 volumes of reports. The Bills of Exchange Act
1882 codifies for the United Kingdom the law relating to bills
of exchange, promissory notes and cheques. One peculiar
Scottish rule is preserved, but in other respects uniform rules
are laid down for England, Scotland and Ireland. After glancing
briefly at the history of these instruments, it will probably be
convenient to discuss the subject in the order followed by the
act, namely, first, to treat of a bill of exchange, which is the
original and typical negotiable instrument, and then to refer to
the special provisions which apply to promissory notes and
cheques. Two salient characteristics distinguish negotiable
instruments from other engagements to pay money. In the first
place, the assignee of a negotiable instrument, to whom it is
transferred by indorsement or delivery according to its tenor,
can sue thereon in his own name; and, secondly, he holds it
by an independent title. If he takes it in good faith and for
value, he takes it free from &ldquo;all equities,&rdquo; that is to say, all
defects of title or grounds of defence which may have attached
to it in the hands of any previous party. These characteristic
privileges were conferred by the law merchant, which is part
of the common law, and are now confirmed by statute.</p>

<p><i>Definition.</i>&mdash;By § 3 of the act a bill of exchange is defined to
be &ldquo;an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person
to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person
to whom it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable
future time a sum certain in money to or to the order
of a specified person, or to bearer.&rdquo;<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The person who gives the
order is called the drawer. The person thereby required to pay
is called the drawee. If he assents to the order, he is then called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page941" id="page941"></a>941</span>
the acceptor. An acceptance must be in writing and must be
signed by the drawee. The mere signature of the drawee is
sufficient (§17). The person to whom the money is payable is
called the payee. The person to whom a bill is transferred by
indorsement is called the indorsee. The generic term &ldquo;holder&rdquo;
includes any person in possession of a bill who holds it either as
payee, indorsee or bearer. A bill which in its origin is payable
to order becomes payable to bearer if it is indorsed in blank.
If the payee is a fictitious person the bill may be treated as
payable to bearer (§7).</p>

<p>The following is a specimen of an ordinary form of a bill of
exchange:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="sc">London</span>, 1<i>st January</i> 1901.</p>
<p> &emsp; £100</p>
<p>Three months after date pay to the order of Mr J. Jones the sum
of one hundred pounds for value received.</p>

<p class="sc" style="text-align: right;">Brown &amp; Co.</p>
<p class="noind">To Messrs. Smith &amp; Sons, Liverpool.</p>
</div>

<p>The scope of the definition given above may be realized by
comparing it with the definition given by Sir John Comyns&rsquo; <i>Digest</i>
in the early part of the 18th century:&mdash;&ldquo;A bill of exchange is
when a man takes money in one country or city upon exchange,
and draws a bill whereby he directs another person in another
country or city to pay so much to A, or order, for value received
of B, and subscribes it.&rdquo; Comyns&rsquo; definition illustrates the
original theory of a bill of exchange. A bill in its origin was a
device to avoid the transmission of cash from place to place
to settle trade debts. Now a bill of exchange is a substitute for
money. It is immaterial whether it is payable in the place where
it is drawn or not. It is immaterial whether it is stated to be
given for value received or not, for the law itself raises a
presumption that it was given for value. But though bills are a
substitute for cash payment, and though they constitute the
commercial currency of the country, they must not be confounded
with money. No man is bound to take a bill in payment of debt
unless he has agreed to do so. If he does take a bill, the instrument
ordinarily operates as conditional, and not as absolute
payment. If the bill is dishonoured the debt revives. Under
the laws of some continental countries, a creditor, as such, is
entitled to draw on his debtor for the amount of his debt, but in
England the obligation to accept or pay a bill rests solely on
actual agreement. A bill of exchange must be an unconditional
order to pay. If an instrument is made payable on a contingency,
or out of a particular fund, so that its payment is dependent on
the continued existence of that fund, it is invalid as a bill,
though it may, of course, avail as an agreement or equitable
assignment. In Scotland it has long been the law that a bill
may operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the
drawee, and § 53 of the act preserves this rule.</p>

<p><i>Stamp.</i>&mdash;Bills of exchange must be stamped, but the act of
1882 does not regulate the stamp. It merely saves the operation
of the stamp laws, which necessarily vary from time to time
according to the fluctuating needs and policy of the exchequer.
Under the Stamp Act 1891, bills payable on demand are subject
to a fixed stamp duty of one penny, and by the Finance Act 1899,
a similar privilege is extended to bills expressed to be payable
not more than three days after sight or date. The stamp may
be impressed or adhesive. All other bills are liable to an <i>ad
valorem</i> duty. Inland bills must be drawn on stamped paper,
but foreign bills, of course, can be stamped with adhesive stamps.
As a matter of policy, English law does not concern itself with
foreign revenue laws. For English purposes, therefore, it is
immaterial whether a bill drawn abroad is stamped in accordance
with the law of its place of origin or not. On arrival in England
it has to conform to the English stamp laws.</p>

<p><i>Maturity.</i>&mdash;A bill of exchange is payable on demand when it is
expressed to be payable on demand, or at sight, or on presentation
or when notice for payment is expressed. In calculating the
maturity of bills payable at a future time, three days, called days
of grace, must be added to the nominal due date of the bill. For
instance, if a bill payable one month after sight is accepted on
the 1st of January, it is really payable on the 4th of February, and
not on the 1st of February as its tenor indicates. On the continent
generally days of grace have been abolished as anomalous and
misleading. Their abolition has been proposed in England, but
it has been opposed on the ground that it would curtail the credit
of small traders who are accustomed to bills drawn at certain
fixed periods of currency. When the last day of grace is a
non-business day some complicated rules come into play (§ 14).
Speaking generally, when the last day of grace falls on Sunday
or a common law holiday the bill is payable on the preceding day,
but when it falls on a bank holiday the bill is payable on the
succeeding day. Complications arise when Sunday is preceded
by a bank holiday; and, to add to the confusion, Christmas day
is a bank holiday in Scotland, but a common law holiday in
England. When the code was in committee an attempt was
made to remove these anomalies, but it was successfully resisted
by the bankers on alleged grounds of practical convenience.</p>

<p><i>Acceptance.</i>&mdash;By the acceptance of a bill the drawee becomes
the principal debtor on the instrument and the party primarily
liable to pay it. The acceptor of a bill &ldquo;by accepting it engages
that he will pay it according to the tenor of his acceptance,&rdquo;
and is precluded from denying the drawer&rsquo;s right to draw or the
genuineness of his signature (§ 54). The acceptance may be
either general or qualified. As a qualified acceptance is so far a
disregard of the drawer&rsquo;s order, the holder is not obliged to take
it; and if he chooses to take it he must give notice to antecedent
parties, acting at his own risk if they dissent (§§ 19 and 44). The
drawer and indorsers of a bill are in the nature of sureties. They
engage that the bill shall be duly accepted and paid according
to its tenor, and that if it is dishonoured by non-acceptance or
non-payment, as the case may be, they will compensate the
holder provided that the requisite proceedings on dishonour are
duly taken. Any indorser who is compelled to pay the bill has
the like remedy as the holder against any antecedent party (§55).
A person who is not the holder of a bill, but who backs it with his
signature, thereby incurs the liability of an indorser to a holder
in due course (§ 56). An indorser may by express term either
restrict or charge his ordinary liability as stated above. Prima
facie every signature to a bill is presumed to have been given for
valuable consideration. But sometimes this is not the case.
For friendship, or other reasons, a man may be willing to lend
his name and credit to another in a bill transaction. Hence arise
what are called <i>accommodation bills</i>. Ordinarily the acceptor
gives his acceptance to accommodate the drawer. But occasionally
both drawer and acceptor sign to accommodate the payee,
or even a person who is not a party to the bill at all. The
criterion of an accommodation bill is the fact that the principal
debtor according to the instrument has lent his name and is in
substance a surety for some one else. The holder for value of an
accommodation bill may enforce it exactly as if it was an ordinary
bill, for that is the presumable intention of the parties. But if
the bill is dishonoured the law takes cognizance of the true
relations of the parties, and many of the rules relating to principal
and surety come into play. Suppose a bill is accepted for the
accommodation of the drawer. It is the drawer&rsquo;s duty to provide
the acceptor with funds to meet the bill at maturity. If he fails
to do so, he cannot rely on the defence that the bill was not duly
presented for payment or that he did not receive due notice
of dishonour. If the holder, with notice of the real state of the
facts, agrees to give time to the drawer to pay, he may thereby
discharge the acceptor.</p>

<p><i>Holder in due Course.</i>&mdash;The holder of a bill has special rights
and special duties. He is the mercantile owner of the bill, but
in order to establish his ownership he must show a mercantile
title. The bill must be negotiated to him, that is to say, it must
be transferred to him according to the forms prescribed by
mercantile law. If the bill is payable to order, he must not only
get possession of the bill, but he must also obtain the indorsement
of the previous holder. If the bill is payable to bearer it
is transferable by mere delivery. A bill is payable to bearer
which is expressed to be so payable, or on which the only or
last indorsement is an indorsement in blank. If a man lawfully
obtains possession of a bill payable to order without the necessary
indorsement, he may obtain some common law rights in respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page942" id="page942"></a>942</span>
of it, but he is not the mercantile owner, and he is not technically
the holder or bearer. But to get the full advantages of mercantile
ownership the holder must be a &ldquo;holder in due course&rdquo;&mdash;that
is to say, he must satisfy three business conditions.
First, he must have given value, or claim through some holder
who has given value. Secondly, when he takes the bill, it must
be regular on the face of it. In particular, the bill must not be
overdue or known to be dishonoured. An overdue bill, or a bill
which has been dishonoured, is still negotiable, but in a restricted
sense. The transferee cannot acquire a better title than the
party from whom he took it had (§ 36). Thirdly, he must take
the bill honestly and without notice of any defect in the title
of the transferor,&mdash;as, for instance, that the bill or acceptance
had been obtained by fraud, or threats or for an illegal consideration.
If he satisfies these conditions he obtains an indefeasible
title, and can enforce the bill against all parties
thereto. The act substitutes the expression &ldquo;holder in due
course&rdquo; for the somewhat cumbrous older expression &ldquo;bona
fide holder for value without notice.&rdquo; The statutory term has
the advantage of being positive instead of negative. The
French equivalent &ldquo;tiers porteur de bonne foi&rdquo; is expressive.
Forgery, of course, stands on a different footing from a mere
defect of title. A forged signature, as a general rule, is a nullity.
A person who claims through a forged signature has no title
himself, and cannot give a title to any one else (§ 24). Two
exceptions to this general rule require to be noted. First, a
banker who in the ordinary course of business pays a demand
draft held under a forged indorsement is protected (§ 60).
Secondly, if a bill be issued with material blanks in it, any person
in possession of it has prima facie authority to fill them up,
and if the instrument when complete gets into the hands of a
holder in due course the presumption becomes absolute. As
between the immediate parties the transaction may amount to
forgery, but the holder in due course is protected (§ 20).</p>

<p><i>Dishonour.</i>&mdash;The holder of a bill has special duties which he
must fulfil in order to preserve his rights against the drawers
and indorsers. They are not absolute duties; they are duties
to use reasonable diligence. When a bill is payable after sight,
presentment for acceptance is necessary in order to fix the
maturity of the bill. Accordingly the bill must be presented
for acceptance within a reasonable time. When a bill is payable
on demand it must be presented for payment within a reasonable
time. When it is payable at a future time it must be presented
on the day that it is due. If the bill is dishonoured the holder
must notify promptly the fact of dishonour to any drawer and
indorser he wishes to charge. If, for example, the holder only
gives notice of dishonour to the last indorser, he could not sue
the drawer unless the last indorser or some other party liable
has duly sent notice to the drawer. When a foreign bill is
dishonoured the holder must cause it to be protested by a
notary public. The bill must be noted for protest on the day
of its dishonour. If this be duly done, the protest, <i>i.e.</i> the formal
notarial certificate attesting the dishonour, can be drawn up at
any time as of the date of the noting. A dishonoured inland bill
may be noted, and the holder can recover the expenses of noting,
but no legal consequences attach thereto. In practice, however,
noting is usually accepted as showing that a bill has been duly
presented and has been dishonoured. Sometimes the drawer
or indorser has reason to expect that the bill may be dishonoured
by the drawee. In that case he may insert the name of a
&ldquo;referee in case of need.&rdquo; But whether he does so or not, when
a bill has been duly noted for protest, any person may, with
the consent of the holder, intervene for the honour of any party
liable on the bill. If the bill has been dishonoured by non-acceptance
it may be &ldquo;accepted for honour <i>supra protest</i>.&rdquo;
If it has been dishonoured by non-payment it may be paid
<i>supra protest</i>. When a bill is thus paid and the proper formalities
are complied with, the person who pays becomes invested with
the rights and duties of the holder so far as regards the party
for whose honour he has paid the bill, and all parties antecedent
to him (§§ 65 to 68).</p>

<p><i>Discharge.</i>&mdash;Normally a bill is discharged by payment in due
course, that is to say, by payment by the drawee or acceptor
to the holder at or after maturity. But it may also be discharged
in other ways, as for example by coincidence of right
and liability (§ 61), voluntary renunciation (§ 62), cancellation
(§ 63), or material alteration (§ 64).</p>

<p><i>Conflict of Laws.</i>&mdash;A bill of exchange is the most cosmopolitan
of all contracts. It may be drawn in one country,
payable in another, and indorsed on its journey to its destination
in two or three more. The laws of all these countries may differ.
Provision for this conflict of laws is made by § 72, which lays
down rules for determining by what law the rights and duties
of the various parties are to be measured and regulated. Speaking
broadly, these rules follow the maxim <i>Locus regit actum</i>.
A man must be expected to know and follow the law of the place
where he conducts his business, but no man can be expected to
know the laws of every country through which a bill may travel.
For safety of transmission from country to country bills are
often made out in sets. The set usually consists of three counterparts,
each part being numbered and containing a reference to
the other parts. The whole set then constitutes one bill, and
the drawee must be careful only to accept one part, otherwise
if different accepted parts get into the hands of different holders,
he may be liable to pay the bill twice (§ 71). Foreign bills
circulating through different countries have given rise to many
intricate questions of law. But the subject is perhaps one of
diminishing importance, as in many trades the system of &ldquo;cable
transfers&rdquo; is superseding the use of bills of exchange.</p>

<p>A cheque &ldquo;is a bill of exchange drawn on a banker payable
on demand&rdquo; (§ 73). For the most part the rules of law applicable
to bills payable on demand apply in their entirety
to cheques. But there are certain peculiar rules
<span class="sidenote">Cheques.</span>
relating to the latter which arise from the fact that the relationship
of banker and customer subsists between the drawer and
drawee of a cheque. For example, when a person has an
account at a bank he is, as an inference of law, entitled to draw
on it by means of cheques. A right to overdraw, can, of course,
only arise from agreement. The drawer of a cheque is not
absolutely discharged by the holder&rsquo;s omission to present it
for payment within a reasonable time. He is only discharged
to the extent of any actual damage he may have suffered through
the delay (§ 74). Apart from any question of delay, a banker&rsquo;s
authority to pay his customer&rsquo;s cheques is determined by
countermand of payment or by notice of the customer&rsquo;s death
(§ 75). Of recent years the use of cheques has enormously
increased, and they have now become the normal machinery by
which all but the smallest debts are discharged. To guard
against fraud, and to facilitate the safe transmission of cheques
by post, a system of crossing has been devised which makes
crossed cheques payable only through certain channels. The
first act which gave legislative recognition to the practice of
crossing was the 19 and 20 Vict. <i>c.</i> 95. That act was amended
in 1858, and a consolidating and amending act was passed in
1876. The act of 1876 is now repealed, and its provisions are
re-enacted with slight modifications by §§ 76 to 82 of the Bills
of Exchange Act 1883. A cheque may be crossed either &ldquo;generally&rdquo;
or &ldquo;specially.&rdquo; A cheque is crossed generally by drawing
across it two parallel lines and writing between them the words
&ldquo;&amp; Co.&rdquo; When a cheque is crossed generally it cannot be paid
over the counter. It must be presented for payment by a
banker. A cheque is crossed specially by adding the name
of the banker, and then it can only be presented through that
particular banker. A cheque, whether crossed generally or
specially, may further be crossed with the words &ldquo;not
negotiable.&rdquo; A cheque crossed &ldquo;not negotiable&rdquo; is still
transferable, but its negotiable quality is restricted. It is
put on pretty much the same footing as an overdue bill. The
person who takes it does not get, and cannot give a better title
to it, than that which the person from whom he took it had.
These provisions are supplemented by provisions for the protection
of paying and collecting bankers who act in good faith
and without negligence. Suppose that a cheque payable to
bearer, which is crossed generally and with the words &ldquo;not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page943" id="page943"></a>943</span>
negotiable,&rdquo; is stolen. The thief then gets a tradesman to
cash it for him, and the tradesman gets the cheque paid on
presentment through his banker. The banker who pays and
the banker who receives the money for the tradesman are protected,
but the tradesman would be liable to refund the money
to the true owner. Again, assuming payment of the cheque
to have been stopped, the tradesman could not maintain an
action against the drawer.</p>

<p>A promissory note is defined by section 83 of the act to be
an &ldquo;unconditional promise in writing made by one person to
another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on
demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time,
<span class="sidenote">Promissory notes.</span>
a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified
person or to bearer.&rdquo;  A promissory note may be made by two
or more makers, and they may be liable either jointly, or jointly
and severally, according to its tenor (§ 85). For the most part,
rules of law applicable to a bill of exchange apply also to a
promissory note, but they require adaptation. A note differs
from a bill in this: it is a direct promise to pay, and not an
order to pay. When it issues it bears on it the engagement
of the principal debtor who is primarily liable thereon. The
formula for applying to notes the rules as to bills is that &ldquo;the
maker of a note shall be deemed to correspond with the acceptor
of a bill, and the first indorser of a note shall be deemed to
correspond with the drawer of a bill payable to drawer&rsquo;s order&rdquo;
(§ 89).  Rules relating to presentment for acceptance, acceptance,
acceptance <i>supra</i> protest, and bills in a set, have no
application to a note. Moreover, when a foreign note is dishonoured
it is not necessary, for English purposes, to protest it.
All promissory notes are, under the Stamp Act 1891, subject to
an <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty.  Inland notes must be on impressed
stamp paper. Foreign notes are stamped with adhesive stamps.
For ordinary legal purposes a bank note may be regarded as a
promissory note made by a banker payable to bearer on demand.
It is, however, subject to special stamp regulations. It is not
discharged by payment, but may be re-issued again and again.
In the interests of the currency the issue of bank notes is subject
to various statutory restrictions. A bank, other than the Bank
of England, may not issue notes in England unless it had a
lawful note issue in 1844. On the other hand, Bank of England
notes are legal tender except by the bank itself.</p>

<p>In fundamental principles there is general agreement between
the laws of all commercial nations regarding negotiable instruments.
As Mr Justice Story, the great American
lawyer, says: &ldquo;The law respecting negotiable instruments
<span class="sidenote">Foreign laws.</span>
may be truly declared, in the language of
Cicero, to be in a great measure not the law of a single country
only, but of the whole commercial world. <i>Non erit lex alia
Romae, alia Athenis, alia nunc alia posthac, sed et apud omnes
gentes et omni tempore, una eademque lex obtinebit</i>&rdquo; (<i>Swift</i> v.
<i>Tyson</i>, 16 Peters i). But in matters of detail each nation
has impressed its individuality on its own system. The English
law has been summarized above. Perhaps its special characteristics
may be best brought out by comparing it with the French
code and noting some salient divergences. English law has
been developed gradually by judicial decision founded on trade
custom. French law was codified in the 17th century by the
&ldquo;Ordonnance de 1673.&rdquo; The existing &ldquo;Code de Commerce&rdquo;
amplifies but substantially adopts the provisions of the &ldquo;Ordonnance.&rdquo;
The growth of French law was thus arrested at an
early period of its development. The result is instructive.
A reference to Marius&rsquo; treatise on bills of exchange, published
about 1670, or Beawes&rsquo; <i>Lex Mercatoria</i>, published about 1740,
shows that the law, or rather the practice, as to bills of exchange
was even then fairly well defined. Comparing the
practice of that time with the law as it now stands, it will be
seen that it has been modified in some important respects.
For the most part, where English law differs from French law,
the latter is in strict accordance with the rules laid down by
Beawes. The fact is that, when Beawes wrote, the law or
practice of both nations on this subject was nearly uniform.
But English law has gone on growing while French law has stood
still. A bill of exchange in its origin was an instrument by
which a trade debt due in one place was transferred to another
place. This theory French law rigidly keeps in view. In England
bills have developed into a paper currency of perfect
flexibility. In France a bill represents a trade transaction;
in England it is merely an instrument of credit. English law
affords full play to the system of accommodation paper; French
law endeavours to stamp it out. A comparison of some of the
main points of difference between English and French law will
show how the two theories work. In England it is no longer
necessary to express on a bill that value has been given for it,
for the law raises a presumption to that effect. In France
the nature of the consideration must be stated, and a false
statement of value avoids the bill in the hands of all parties
with notice. In England a bill may be drawn and payable in the
same place. In France the place where a bill is drawn should
be so far distant from the place where it is payable that there
may be a possible rate of exchange between the two. This so-called
rule of <i>distantia loci</i> is said to be disregarded now in practice,
but the code is unaltered. As French lawyers put it, a bill of
exchange necessarily presupposes a contract of exchange. In
England since 1765 a bill may be drawn payable to bearer,
though formerly it was otherwise. In France it must be payable
to order; if it were not so it is clear that the rule requiring the
consideration to be truly stated would be a nullity. In England
a bill originally payable to order becomes payable to bearer
when indorsed in blank. In France an indorsement in blank
merely operates as a procuration. An indorsement, to operate
as a negotiation, must be to order, and must state the consideration;
in short, it must conform to the conditions of an original
draft. In England, if a bill is dishonoured by non-acceptance,
a right of action at once accrues to the holder. In France no
cause of action arises unless the bill is again dishonoured at
maturity; the holder in the meantime is only entitled to demand
security from the drawer and indorsers. In England a sharp
distinction is drawn between current and overdue bills. In
France no such distinction is drawn. In England no protest
is required in the case of the dishonour of an inland bill, notice
of dishonour being sufficient. In France every dishonoured
bill must be protested. Opinions may differ whether the English
or the French system is better calculated to serve sound commerce
and promote a healthy commercial morality. But an argument
in favour of the English system may be derived from the fact
that as the various continental codes are from time to time
revised and re-enacted, they tend to depart from the French
model and to approximate to the English rule. The effect
upon English law of its codification has yet to be proved. A
common objection to codification in England is that it deprives
the law of its elastic character. But when principles are once
settled common law has very little elasticity. On the other
hand no code is final. Modern parliaments legislate very freely,
and it is a much simpler task to alter statute law than to alter
common law. Moreover, legislation is cheaper than litigation.
One consequence of the codification of the English law relating
to bills is clear gain. Nearly all the British colonies have
adopted the act, and where countries are so closely connected
as England and her colonies, it is an obvious advantage that
their mercantile transactions should be governed by one and the
same law expressed in the same words.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILL OF RIGHTS,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> an important statute in English constitutional
history. On the 13th of February 1689 the Declaration
of Right, a document drawn up by a committee of the commons,
and embodying the fundamental principles of the constitution,
was delivered by the lords and commons to the prince and
princess of Orange, afterwards William III. and Mary. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page944" id="page944"></a>944</span>
December 1689 the rights claimed by the declaration were
enacted with some alterations by the Bill of Rights, next to
Magna Carta the greatest landmark in the constitutional history
of England and the nearest approach to the written constitutions
of other countries. The act (the full name of which is An Act
declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and settling
the Succession of the Crown), after reciting the unconstitutional
proceedings of James II., the abdication of that king, the consequent
vacancy of the crown, and the summons of the convention
parliament, declared, on the part of the lords and commons, &ldquo;for
the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;(1) That the pretended power of suspending of laws or the
execution of laws by regal authority without consent of parliament
is illegal. (2) That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or
the execution of laws by regal authority, as it hath been assumed
and exercised of late, is illegal. (3) That the commission for erecting
the late court of commissioners for ecclesiastical causes, and all other
commissions and courts of like nature, are illegal and pernicious.
(4) That levying money for or to the use of the crown, by pretence
of prerogative, without grant of parliament, for longer time or in
other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal. (5)
That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all commitments
and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal. (6) That
the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in
time of peace, unless it be with consent of parliament, is against
law. (7) That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms
for their defence suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.
(8) That elections of members of parliament ought to be free. (9)
That the freedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in parliament,
ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place
out of parliament. (10) That excessive bail ought not to be required,
nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments
inflicted. (11) That jurors ought to be duly impanelled and returned
and jurors which pass upon men in trials for high treason ought to
be freeholders. (12) That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures
of particular persons before conviction are illegal and void.
(13) And that for redress of all grievances, and for the amending,
strengthening and preserving of the laws, parliament ought to be held
frequently. And they do claim, demand and insist upon all and
singular the premises, as their undoubted rights and liberties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The further provisions of the act were concerned with the
settlement of the crown upon the prince and princess of Orange,
with the exception of § 12, which negatived the right of dispensation
by <i>non obstante</i><a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> to or of any statute or any part
thereof, unless a dispensation be allowed in the statute itself or
by bill or bills to be passed during the then session of parliament.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that the Declaration of Right and the Bill
of Rights introduced no new principle into the English constitution;
it was merely a declaration of the law as it stood. In the
United States, the main provisions of the Bill of Rights, so far
as they are applicable, have been adopted both in the constitution
of the United States and in the state constitutions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILL OF SALE,<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> in its original sense, a legal document assigning
personal property, and still used in connexion with the transference
of property in ships. The term has come to be applied
to mortgages as well as to sales, and the expression &ldquo;bill of
sale&rdquo; may now be understood to signify generally a document
evidencing a sale or mortgage of personal chattels, unaccompanied
by an actual transfer of possession to the purchaser or mortgagor.</p>

<p>The first English legislation on the subject was the Bills of Sale
Act 1854, which, after reciting that &ldquo;frauds were frequently
committed upon creditors by secret bills of sale of personal
chattels, whereby persons are enabled to keep up the appearance
of being in good circumstances and possessed of property, and
the grantees or holders of such bills of sale have the power of
taking possession of the property of such person to the exclusion
of the rest of their creditors,&rdquo; provided that all bills of sale, as
defined in the act, should be void against execution creditors
unless registered. This act was amended by the Bills of Sale
Act 1866. These acts were repealed and a new act passed, the
Bills of Sale Act 1878, which, in the main, followed the lines of
the act of 1854. The scope of this legislation was very much
widened by the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882,
which was intended primarily &ldquo;to prevent needy persons being
entrapped into signing complicated documents which they might
often be unable to comprehend, and so being subjected by their
creditors to the enforcement of harsh and unreasonable provisions&rdquo;
(<i>Manchester &amp;c. Ry. Co.</i> v. <i>N.C. Wagon Co.</i>, 1888,
13 App. Ca. 554). The law is now regulated by these two acts,
together with the Bills of Sale Acts of 1890 and 1891, which
effected further small amendments by excluding from the
operation of the principal acts instruments hypothecating,
charging or declaring trusts on imported goods, during the
interval between their unloading from a ship and their deposit
in a warehouse, or re-shipping.</p>

<p>Under the acts of 1878 and 1882 bills of sale are of two kinds,
<i>i.e. absolute bills of sale</i> (where chattels are sold absolutely to a
purchaser), and <i>bills of sale by way of security for the payment
of money</i>. The Bills of Sale Act 1878 governs both kinds and is
the only act which applies to absolute bills. Bills of sale given
by way of security for the payment of money on or after the
1st of November 1882 are governed by the act of 1882, which,
however, does not apply to absolute bills. Section 4 of the act
of 1878 defines a bill of sale as (1) including bills of sale, assignments,
transfers, declarations of trust without transfer, inventories
of goods with receipt thereto attached, or receipts for
purchase moneys of goods and other assurances of personal
chattels; the term assurance has been best explained as a
document &ldquo;on which the title of the transferee of the goods
depends, either as the actual transfer of the property, or an
agreement to transfer,&rdquo; <i>Marsden</i> v. <i>Meadows</i>, 1881, 7 Q.B.D.
80; (2) powers of attorney, authorities or licences to take
possession of personal chattels as security for any debt; these
words would not include a power of distress for rent in an ordinary
lease or bona fide hiring or hire purchase agreements; (3) any
agreement, whether intended or not to be followed by the execution
of any other instrument, by which a right in equity to any
personal chattels, or to any charge or security thereon, shall be
conferred; (4) any mode of disposition of trade machinery and
attornments and other instruments giving powers of distress
to secure a debt or advance. On the other hand, certain assurances
and instruments are expressly exempt by statute from the
definition: marriage settlements, assignments of ships, assignments
for the benefit of creditors, bills of lading and dock
warrants, and by the act of 1882, debentures and debenture
stock of a company. The expression &ldquo;personal chattels&rdquo; is
defined as goods, furniture and other articles capable of complete
transfer by delivery, and (when separately assigned or charged)
fixtures and growing crops.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Absolute Bills.</i>&mdash;Absolute bills of sale must be duly attested by
a solicitor, and the attestation must state that before execution
the effect of it was explained to the grantor by the attesting solicitor.
The consideration must be truly stated. The bill of sale, and all
schedules and inventories annexed to or referred to in the bill, and
also a true copy of the bill and of every schedule and inventory
and of every attestation, together with an affidavit stating the time
of making or giving the bill, its due execution and attestation and
the residence and occupation of the grantor, and every attesting
witness, must be presented to, and the copies filed by, the registrar
within seven clear days. In the case of absolute bills the effect of
non-compliance does not affect the validity of the bill as between
the parties to it, but makes it void as against the trustee in bankruptcy
and execution creditors of the grantor.</p>

<p><i>Bills by Way of Security.</i>&mdash;All bills of sale given by way of security
for the repayment of money must be made in accordance with the
form given in the schedule to the act of 1882, and they must not
depart from the statutory form in anything which is not merely a
matter of verbal difference. The form given in the schedule to the
act is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>This Indenture made the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; day of &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; between A. B.
of &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; of the one part and C. D. of &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; of the
other part, witnesseth that in consideration of the sum
of £ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; now paid to A. B. by C. D, the receipt of which the said
A. B. hereby acknowledges, he the said A. B. doth hereby assign
unto C. D. his executors, administrators and assigns all and singular
the several chattels and things specifically described in the schedule
hereto annexed by way of security for the payment of the sum of
£ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and interest thereon at the rate of &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; % per annum. And
the said A. B. doth further agree and declare that he will duly pay
to the said C. D. the principal sum aforesaid together with the interest
then due, by equal &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; payments of £ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; on the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; day of
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And the said A. B. doth also agree with the said C. D.
that he will (<i>here insert terms as to insurance, payment of rent, &amp;c.,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page945" id="page945"></a>945</span>
<i>which the parties may agree to for the maintenance or defeasance of
the security</i>). Provided always that the chattels hereby assigned
shall not be liable to seizure or to be taken possession of by the said
C. D. for any cause other than those specified in § 7 of the Bills of
Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882.</p>

<p>In witness, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Signed and sealed by the said A. B. in the presence of me E. F.
(<i>add witness&rsquo;s name, address and description</i>).</p>

<p>Non-compliance with the requirement of the statute as to form
renders a bill of sale void even as between the parties. The bill of
sale must have annexed to it an inventory of the chattels comprised
in it, and is void, except as against the grantor, in respect of any
personal chattels not specifically described. It must be duly attested
by one or more credible witnesses (not necessarily by a solicitor,
as in the case of absolute bills). Every witness must sign his name
and add his address and description. It must be duly registered
within seven clear days after the execution thereof, or if it is executed
in any place out of England then within seven clear days after the
time at which it would in the ordinary course of post arrive in
England if posted immediately after the execution. It must truly
set forth the consideration. The grantor must be the true owner
of the goods described in the schedule; as to any personal chattels
of which he is not the true owner, the bill is void, except as against
the grantor. Every bill of sale made or given in consideration of any
sum under £30 is void. By § 7 of the act personal chattels shall only
be liable to be seized or taken possession of in the following cases:&mdash;(1)
If the grantor make default in payment of the debt or in the
performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the bill and
necessary for maintaining the security; (2) if the grantor becomes
a bankrupt or suffers the goods to be distrained for rent, rates or
taxes; (3) if the grantor fraudulently removes the goods from the
premises; (4) if the grantor does not, without reasonable excuse,
upon demand in writing by the grantee, produce to him his last
receipts for rent, rates or taxes; (5) if execution is levied against
the goods of the grantor under any judgment. By § 13 personal
chattels seized or taken possession of under a bill must not be removed
or sold until after the expiration of five clear days from the
date of seizure, and, if the goods have been wrongly seized, the
grantor may within the five days apply to the High Court or a judge
in chambers for an order to restrain the grantee from removing or
selling the goods. The Bills of Sale Acts 1878 and 1882 do not apply
to Scotland or Ireland. According to Scots law no security or charge
can be created over moveable property without delivery of possession.
The Irish statutes corresponding to the English acts are the Bills
of Sale (Ireland) Act 1879 and the Amendment Act 1883.</p>

<p>The stamp duties payable on an absolute bill of sale are 2s. 6d.
on every £25 secured up to £300; over £300, 5s. on every £50. On
bills of sale by way of security, 1s. 3d. for every £50 up to £300
secured; over £300, 2s. 6d. for every £100. The fees payable on
filing a bill of sale are, 5s. where the consideration (including further
advances) does not exceed £100; above £100 and not exceeding
£200, 10s.; above £200, £1.</p>

<p>The various trade protection papers always publish the registration
of a bill of sale, and the usual effect is, therefore, to destroy
the credit of any person giving one.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILLROTH, ALBERT CHRISTIAN THEODOR<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1829-1894),
Viennese surgeon, was born on the 26th of April 1829 at Bergen,
on the island of Rügen, his family being of Swedish origin. He
studied at the universities of Greifswald, Göttingen and Berlin,
and after taking his doctor&rsquo;s degree at the last in 1852, started
on an educational tour, in the course of which he visited the
medical schools of Vienna, Prague, Paris, Edinburgh and London.
On his return to Berlin he acted as assistant to B.R.K.
Langenbeck from 1853 to 1860, and then accepted the professorship
of surgery at Zürich. In 1867 he was invited to fill the same
position at Vienna, and in that city the remainder of his professional
life was spent. In 1887 he received the distinction,
rarely bestowed on members of his profession, of a seat in the
Austrian <i>Herrnhaus</i>. He died at Abbazia, on the Adriatic,
where he had a beautiful villa, on the 6th of February 1894.
Billroth was one of the most distinguished surgeons of his day.
His boldness as an operator was only equalled by his skill and
resourcefulness; no accident or emergency could disturb his
coolness and presence of mind, and his ability to invent or carry
out any new procedure that might be demanded in the particular
case with which he was dealing, gained for him the appellation
of &ldquo;surgeon of great initiatives.&rdquo; At the same time he was full
of consideration for the comfort and well-being of his patient,
and never forgot that he had before him a human being to be
relieved, not a mere &ldquo;case&rdquo; for the display of technical dexterity.
He was especially interested in military surgery, and during the
Franco-German War volunteered to serve in the hospitals of
Mannheim and Weissenburg. His efforts did much to improve
the arrangements for the transport and treatment of the wounded
in war, and in a famous speech on the War Budget in 1891, he
eloquently urged the necessity for an improved ambulance
system, pointing out that the use of smokeless powder and the
greater precision of the arms of modern warfare must tend to
increase the number of men wounded, and that therefore more
efficient means must be provided for removing them from the
battlefield. Possessing a clear and graceful style, he was the
author of numerous papers and books on medical subjects; his
<i>Allgemeine chirurgische Pathologie und Therapie</i> (1863) ran
through many editions, and was translated into many languages.
He was of an exceedingly artistic disposition, and in particular
was devoted to music. A good performer on the pianoforte and
violin, he was an intimate friend and admirer of Brahms, many
of whose compositions were privately performed at his house
before they were published. His work on the physiology of
music (<i>Wer ist musikalisch?</i>) was published after his death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILMA,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Kawar</span>, an oasis in the heart of the Sahara desert,
some 60 m. long by 10 broad. The inhabitants are Tibbu and
Kanuri. The name Bilma is properly confined to the southern
part of this region, where is the chief settlement, called Bilma
or Garu. This place is 800 m. due S. of the town of Tripoli
and about 350 N. of the N.W. corner of Lake Chad. In the
vicinity are a number of lakes, the waters of which on evaporation
yield large quantities of very pure and fine salt, which is
the object of an extensive trade with the countries of Central
Africa. North of Bilma is the town of Dirki, said to date from
the 11th century. Near Bilma is a small circular oasis, kept
green by a fine spring, but immediately to the south begins the
most dreary part of the Saharan desert, over which the caravans
travel for fifteen days without discovering the slightest trace of
vegetable life. Gustav Nachtigal, who visited Bilma in 1870,
records that the temperature during the day rarely sank below
113° Fahr. By the Anglo-French Declaration of the 21st of
March 1899 Bilma was included in the French sphere of influence
in West Africa. Turkey claimed the oasis as part of the hinterland
of Tripoli and garrisoned Bilma in 1902. In 1906, however,
a French force from Zinder occupied the town, no opposition
being offered by the Ottoman authorities. In 1907 the oasis and
surrounding district was created a circle of the Military Territory
of the Niger (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sahara</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BILNEY, THOMAS<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (d. 1531), English martyr, was born at or
near Norwich. The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but
at all events it was not before 1495. He was educated at Trinity
Hall, Cambridge, graduating LL.B. and taking holy orders in
1519. Finding no satisfaction in the mechanical system of the
schoolmen, he turned his attention to the edition of the New
Testament published by Erasmus in 1516. &ldquo;Immediately,&rdquo;
he records, &ldquo;I felt a marvellous comfort and quietness.&rdquo; The
Scriptures now became his chief study, and his influence led
other young Cambridge men to think along the same lines.
Among his friends were Matthew Parker, the future archbishop
of Canterbury, and Hugh Latimer. Latimer, previously a
strenuous conservative, was completely won over, and a warm
friendship sprang up between him and Bilney. &ldquo;By his confession,&rdquo;
said Latimer, &ldquo;I learned more than in twenty years
before.&rdquo; In 1525 Bilney obtained a licence to preach throughout
the diocese of Ely. He denounced saint and relic worship,
together with pilgrimages to Walsingham and Canterbury, and
refused to accept the mediation of the saints. The diocesan
authorities raised no objection, for, despite his reforming views
in these directions, he was to the last perfectly orthodox on
the power of the pope, the sacrifice of the mass, the doctrine
of transubstantiation and the authority of the church. But
Wolsey took a different view. In 1526 he appears to have
summoned Bilney before him. On his taking an oath that he
did not hold and would not disseminate the doctrines of Luther,
Bilney was dismissed. But in the following year serious objection
was taken to a series of sermons preached by him in and near
London, and he was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower.
Arraigned before Wolsey, Warham, archbishop of Canterbury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page946" id="page946"></a>946</span>
and several bishops in the chapter-house at Westminster, he
was convicted of heresy, sentence being deferred while efforts
were made to induce him to recant, which eventually he did.
After being kept for more than a year in the Tower, he was
released in 1529, and went back to Cambridge. Here he was
overcome with remorse for his apostasy, and after two years
determined to preach again what he had held to be the truth.
The churches being no longer open to him, he preached openly
in the fields, finally arriving in Norwich, where the bishop,
Richard Nix, caused him to be arrested. Articles were drawn
up against him by Convocation, he was tried, degraded from
his orders and handed over to the civil authorities to be burned.
The sentence was carried out in London on the 19th of August
1531. A parliamentary inquiry was threatened into this case, not
because parliament approved of Bilney&rsquo;s doctrine but because it
was alleged that Bilney&rsquo;s execution had been obtained by the ecclesiastics
without the proper authorization by the state. In 1534
Bishop Nix was condemned on this charge to the confiscation of
his property. The significance of Bilney&rsquo;s execution lies in the
fact that on essential points he was an orthodox Roman Catholic.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BILOXI,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> a city of Harrison county, Mississippi, U.S.A., in
the south part of the state, on Biloxi Bay, a branch of the
Mississippi Sound, which is a part of the Gulf of Mexico. By
rail it is 80 m. N.E. of New Orleans and 61 m. S.E. of Mobile,
Alabama. Pop. (1880) 1540; (1890) 3234; (1900) 5467 (949 being
negroes and 455 foreign-born); (1910) 7988. The city
is served by a branch of the Louisville &amp; Nashville railway,
and by an electric railway extending to Bay St Louis, through
Gulfport (pop., 1900, 1060; 1910, 6386), 13 m. S.W., the port of
entry of the Pearl River customs district, whose exports, chiefly
timber, lumber, naval stores and charcoal, were valued at
$8,392,271 in 1907. Biloxi is both a summer and a winter resort,
particularly for the people of New Orleans and Mobile, and has
a fine beach, extending for about 12 m. around its peninsula,
and bordered by an automobile drive; along the beach are some
attractive residences, hotels and boarding houses, and several
sanatoriums. The city&rsquo;s principal industries are the canning
of oysters, shrimp, fish, figs and vegetables, and the manufacture
of fertilizers and flour. A beautiful thin faience with remarkable
metallic glazes is made here. The municipality owns the water-works,
the water being obtained from artesian wells. Pierre
le Moyne d&rsquo;Iberville (1661-1706) in 1699 built Fort Maurepas
across the bay from the present city; and the settlement there,
called Biloxi after the Biloxi Indians, was the first to be established
by the French in this region. In 1702 this post, known
as Old Biloxi, was abandoned, and the seat of government was
removed to the Mobile river. In 1712 a settlement was made
on the present site, being the first permanent settlement within
what is now the state of Mississippi. Many of the early settlers
were French Canadians, who came down the Mississippi to join
the new colony. Biloxi was again the capital from 1719 until
1722. It was incorporated as a village in 1872, and was chartered
as a city in 1896.</p>

productive mines of coal and ironstone, as well as sand of fine
quality for casting, and grinding-stones for cutlers. Bilston
contains numerous furnaces, forges, rolling and slitting mills
for the preparation of iron, and a great variety of factories
for japanned and painted goods, brass-work and heavy iron
goods. Though retaining no relics of antiquity, the town is
very ancient, appearing in Domesday. The parish church of
St Leonard, dating as it stands mainly from 1827, is on the site
of a building of the 13th century. Bilston suffered severely
from an outbreak of cholera in 1832. The town is within the
parliamentary borough of Wolverhampton.</p>

be included in Bimana. Again and again it has been proved that
the human great toe can be by constant practice used as a thumb;
artists exist who have painted pictures grasping the brush with
their toes, and violinists have been known to play their instruments
in the same manner. Among many savage races there is
developed a remarkable power of foot-grasp, which in a lesser
degree is often so noticeable among sailors. Haeckel calls attention
to the fact that a baby can hold a spoon with the big-toe as
with a thumb. Man, in a word, is potentially quadrumanous.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIMETALLISM<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span>. The very general employment of both gold
and silver for currency purposes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Money</a></span>) has given rise to
serious practical difficulties which have in turn led to keen
theoretical discussion as to the proper remedies to be employed.
Though every arrangement under which two metals form the
money of a region may be described as &ldquo;bimetallism,&rdquo; the
term&mdash;as often happens in economics&mdash;has received a specialized
meaning. It denotes a system under which the two metals are
freely received by the mint and are equally available as legal
tender. The last clause implies the establishment of a definite
ratio in value between the two metals (<i>e.g.</i> 1 oz. of gold = 15½ oz.
of silver) so that the title &ldquo;rated bimetallism&rdquo; may be given
to it, in contradistinction to the &ldquo;unrated bimetallism&rdquo; which
exists wherever two metals circulate together, but have their
relative values determined, not by law, but by &ldquo;the higgling
of the market.&rdquo; Further, the inventor of the term&mdash;H. Cernuschi
in 1869&mdash;regarded it as properly applicable to an international
arrangement by which a number of states agree to adopt the
same ratio, rather than to the use of the two metals by a single
country, which may be described as national bimetallism. International
bimetallism is at all events the form which has attracted
attention in recent times, and it is certainly the most important.</p>

<p>Regarded from the historical point of view it appears that the
failure of separate countries to maintain the two metals in
circulation was the cause which produced the idea of bimetallism
as an international system. We find first the upholders of a
national double standard, as in France and the United States,
and these are followed by the advocates of bimetallism set up
by a combination of countries. The theoretical considerations
which underlie the controversy between the supporters and the
opponents of bimetallism find their appropriate place in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Money</a></span>, as does also the earlier history of the double
standard. The circumstances that have led to the prominence of
the bimetallic question and the principal events that have marked
the course of the movement form the subject of this article.</p>

<p>In the earlier years of the 19th century, when the monetary
disturbances that resulted from the Revolutionary wars had
ceased, we find France (1803) and the United States (1792) with
the double standard legally established. England, on the other
hand, had in 1816 accepted by law the gold standard, which had
come into use in the 18th century. Silver formed the currency
of the other European countries. The great discoveries of gold
in California (1848) and Australia (1851) brought about the
displacement of silver by gold in France, and the continuance
of gold as the principal currency metal in the United States,
where by the law of 1834 it had been somewhat over-rated (1 : 16),
as compared with the ratio adopted in France (1 : 15½), and had
therefore expelled most of the silver previously in circulation.
Between 1848 and 1860 over £100,000,000 of gold was coined
in France, while an equivalent amount of silver was exported,
principally to the East.</p>

<p>At this time the weight of economic and official opinion was
very decidedly in favour of the single gold standard as the best
system. In 1865 the Latin Union was established, in which the
French currency system was adopted and was followed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page947" id="page947"></a>947</span>
international conference of 1867 in Paris (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monetary Conferences</a></span>),
when gold was unanimously accepted as the standard
for the proposed international system to be produced by coordinating
the various currencies with that of the Latin Union.</p>

<p>A series of political and economic events speedily changed
this situation. The Franco-German War (1870-71) deposed
France from her leading position, and led to the establishment
of a German gold currency with a different unit from the franc,
accompanied by the demonetization of the silver currencies
previously in use in the German states. The United States,
where an inconvertible paper currency had been introduced
during the Civil War, formally established the gold dollar as the
standard coin (1873) and arranged for a return to specie payments
(1878). At this time, too, the great production of gold which
had marked the period 1850-1870 diminished, while very
productive silver mines were discovered in the Pacific states of
America. As a result of these combined influences the gold
price of silver, which had risen a little during the height of the
gold discoveries, began to fall rapidly, and the reverse process
to that by which France had in the &rsquo;fifties acquired a gold currency
came into operation. Silver, in accordance with <i>Gresham&rsquo;s Law</i>,
was imported and offered for coinage. To obviate this the
policy of limiting the coinage of silver (the <i>Limping Standard</i>)
was adopted by the Latin Union. A further fall in the gold
price of silver naturally resulted, and this made the position of
Eastern trade and the finances of the Indian government insecure.
American silver producers, and the German government,
as holders of a large mass of demonetized silver, were also
sufferers by the depreciation. The effect on public and official
opinion was shown by the English parliamentary committee
on the depreciation of silver (1876), the American silver commission
of the same year, and the appearance of many works
on the subject, most of them advocating the double standard.
On the initiative of the United States an international monetary
conference met in Paris in 1878, but though the necessity of
keeping a place for silver in the money of the world was recognized,
the proposal to adopt the double standard for general use
was rejected by the European states. By the Bland-Allison Act
(Feb. 1878) the United States had provided for the coinage of a
certain amount of silver per month as a mode of keeping up the
price of the metal, which notwithstanding fell to 48 pence per oz.
in 1879. The prolonged depression of trade in America and
Germany was attributed to the scarcity of money, due to what
was described as &ldquo;the outlawry of silver.&rdquo; By the joint action
of France and the United States a fresh monetary conference
was held in Paris in 1881, where the advocates of bimetallism
were very strongly represented. After prolonged discussion no
conclusion was reached, in consequence of the refusal of England
and Germany to abandon the gold standard. Though an
adjournment to the following year was resolved on, the conference
did not reassemble, and the bimetallic movement took the form
of agitation, carried on in each country. The English inquiry
into the depression of trade (1885-1886) drew from the commission
a recommendation for a fresh commission to investigate the
relation of gold and silver. This latter body, appointed in 1886,
obtained a great body of important evidence, and in 1888 closed
its work by a report in which the views of the two sections of the
commission were separately presented. Six members supported
the existing gold standard and six were in favour of the bimetallic
system. This inconclusive result was soon followed in the
United States by the Sherman Act (1890), providing for a larger
monthly coinage of silver. A temporary rise in the price of the
metal was followed by a further fall, making the situation still
more critical. A new monetary conference was summoned by
the United States and met in Brussels in November 1892. To
modify opposition the &ldquo;desirability of increasing the use of
silver&rdquo; was the resolution proposed; the actual method being
left open. This conference also proved abortive and adjourned
to 1893, but like that of 1881 did not meet again.</p>

<p>International action having failed to secure any system of
bimetallism, the United States and India sought to relieve their
position by local legislation. The former repealed the Sherman
Act, and the latter closed its mints to the free coinage of silver
(1893). As these measures were opposed to bimetallism in that
they restricted the use of silver, and were followed by a lower
price for that metal than had ever been known, the agitation in
the United States and Europe continued. In America it took
the form of advocating the free coinage of silver by the United
States without waiting for other countries; and in this shape
made the principal issue at the presidential elections of 1896 and
1900, in each of which it was emphatically rejected.</p>

<p>A further attempt at securing international bimetallism was
made by Senator Wolcott&rsquo;s commission in 1897. The American
envoys, in concert with the French government, proposed to
England (1) the reopening of the Indian mints, and (2) the
annual purchase by England of £10,000,000 of silver. The
French minister claimed further concessions which were regarded
as inadmissible by the English government; but the fate of the
mission was settled by the refusal of the Indian government to
reopen its mints.</p>

<p>After the American election of 1900, bimetallism as a popular
cause disappeared from view. The silver issue was withdrawn
from the democratic platform in 1904, and the bimetallic movement
died out in England.</p>

<p>Amongst the causes of this collapse the most important are:
(1) the adoption of the <i>gold standard</i> by so many countries&mdash;Austria-Hungary
(1892), Russia and Japan (1897), India (1899),
Mexico (1904)-a movement which pointed to the complete
triumph of gold in the future; (2) the great increase in the
output of gold. Australia and South Africa so developed their
gold mines as to bring the yield for 1906 to £81,000,000 as contrasted
with the less than £20,000,000 of 1883. This growing
supply removed all that dread of a &ldquo;gold famine&rdquo; which served
as a popular argument with bimetallists. To these may be added
(3) the knowledge that experience had brought of the difficulties
surrounding any attempt to establish a common ratio where
the interests of different countries are so opposed; and (4) the
great expansion of trade and industry, concomitantly with the
wider adoption of the gold standard. Therefore, to quote the
words of perhaps the ablest advocate of bimetallism, &ldquo;The
outcome of the prolonged controversy ... appears to be that
the commercial world will carry on its business principally and
more and more on a gold basis, and that particular countries will
endeavour in different ways to adjust their actual medium ...
to the gold standard&rdquo; (Nicholson, <i>Money and Monetary Problems</i>,
6th ed.).</p>

<p>Perhaps the principal service rendered by the many able
minds engaged in the movement will prove to be the fuller
development of the more difficult parts of monetary theory and
the additional light thrown on the course of monetary history.</p>

<p>A proposal, sometimes confounded with bimetallism, is that
for a standard composed of both gold and silver, which is better
described as the <i>Joint-standard</i> or as <i>Symmetallism</i>.</p>

on the main line to Cologne. Pop. (1905) 9950. It is situated on
the left bank of the Rhine opposite Rüdesheim, at the confluence
of the Nahe (or Nava), which is crossed near its mouth by a stone
bridge, attributed to Drusus, and certainly of Roman origin, and
an iron railway bridge. On a height immediately to the south-east
is the ruined castle of Klopp, on the site of a fortress founded
by Drusus, and higher still the celebrated chapel of St Roch
(rebuilt in 1895 after a fire), where thousands of pilgrims gather
on the first Sunday after the 16th of August. Apart from its
situation, which renders it a convenient place of tourist resort,
the town itself presents but few attractions. There are a
Protestant and three Roman Catholic churches, among the latter
the parish church with a crypt dating from the 11th century, and
a medieval town hall. It has a considerable commerce in wine,
grain and cattle, and, new quays and a harbour having been
recently constructed, does an extensive transit trade in coal and
iron. A short way down the Rhine is the Bingerloch, a famous
whirlpool, while about halfway between it and the town rises on

<p><span class="bold">BINGHAM, JOSEPH<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (1668-1723), English scholar and divine,
was born at Wakefield in Yorkshire in September 1668. He
was educated at University College, Oxford, of which he was made
fellow in 1689 and tutor in 1691. A sermon preached by him
from the university pulpit, St Mary&rsquo;s, on the meaning of the
terms &ldquo;Person&rdquo; and &ldquo;Substance&rdquo; in the Fathers, brought upon
him a most unjust accusation of heresy. He was compelled to
give up his fellowship and leave the university; but he was
immediately presented by Dr John Radcliffe to the rectory of
Headbournworthy, near Winchester (1695). In this country
retirement he began his laborious and valuable work entitled
<i>Origines Ecclesiasticae</i>, or Antiquities of the Christian Church,
the first volume of which appeared in 1708 and the tenth and
last in 1722. His design, learnedly, exhaustively and impartially
executed, was &ldquo;to give such a methodical account of the antiquities
of the Christian Church as others have done of the Greek
and Roman and Jewish antiquities, by reducing the ancient
customs, usages and practices of the church under certain proper
heads, whereby the reader may take a view at once of any particular
usage or custom of Christians for four or five centuries.&rdquo;
Notwithstanding his learning and merit, Bingham received no
higher preferment than that of Headbournworthy till 1712,
when he was collated to the rectory of Havant, near Portsmouth,
by Sir Jonathan Trelawney, bishop of Winchester. Nearly all
his little property was lost in the great South Sea Bubble of 1720.
He died on the 17th of August 1723.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BINGHAMTON,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Broome
county, New York, U.S.A., in the south part of the state, on both
banks of the north branch of the Susquehanna river, at the mouth
of the Chenango river. Pop. (1880) 17,317; (1890) 35,005;
(1900) 39,647, of whom 4272 were foreign-born; (1910), 48,443.
It is an important railway centre, being served by the Delaware
&amp; Hudson, the Erie, and the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western
railways; and an extensive system of electric railways
connects it with the suburbs and neighbouring towns.
Binghamton is picturesquely situated and has a number of
parks, the most attractive of which are Ross Park of 100 acres,
and Ely Park of 134 acres. Among the principal buildings are
the city hall, the court-house, the post-office, the Binghamton
city hospital, Stone opera-house, the Carnegie library (1904),
the central high school, and a state armoury. Binghamton has
also some fine office buildings. Among the city&rsquo;s educational
and charitable institutions are the Lady Jane Grey school (for
girls), St Joseph&rsquo;s academy, St Mary&rsquo;s home for orphans, the
Susquehanna Valley orphan asylum, and a state hospital for
the insane. Binghamton is a manufacturing centre of considerable
importance, ranking twelfth in the state in 1905 in the value
of factory products, $13,907,403, which was an increase of
32.0% over the value of the factory products in 1900; among
its manufactures are tobacco, cigars, chewing tobacco and snuff
(value in 1905, $2,879,217), patent medicines (value in 1905,
$2,133,198), flour and grist mill products ($1,089,910), men&rsquo;s
clothing ($833,835), and, of less importance, commercial and
computing scales and time recorders, chemicals, distilled liquor,
beer, fire-alarm apparatus, overalls, agricultural implements,
wagons, electrical apparatus, refined oil, sheet metal, paper
bags and envelopes, tacks and nails, window glass, glass-ware,
clocks, whips and furniture (especially Morris chairs). In the
village of Lestershire (pop. in 1910, 3775; incorporated in 1892),
about 2 m. west, and in Endicott, another suburb, are large boot
and shoe factories. The municipality owns and operates the
water-works. When Binghamton was first settled, about 1787,
it was known as Chenango Point. Its site was originally included
in the so-called &ldquo;Bingham Patent,&rdquo; a tract on both sides of the
Susquehanna river owned by William Bingham (1751-1804), a
Philadelphia merchant, who was a member of the Continental
Congress in 1787-1788 and of the United States Senate in 1795-1801,
being president <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate from the 16th
of February to the 3rd of March 1797. In 1800 a village was
laid out by an agent of Mr Bingham, and was named Binghamton.
In 1834 it was incorporated as a village, and in 1867 was
chartered as a city.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BINIOU,<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bignou</span>, a species of cornemuse or bagpipe, still
in use at the present day in Brittany. The biniou is a primitive
kind of bagpipe consisting of a leather bag inflated by means of
a short valved insufflation tube or blow-pipe, a chaunter with
conical bore furnished with a double reed concealed within the
stock or socket (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bag-Pipe</a></span>), and seven holes, the first being
duplicated to accommodate left- and right-handed players.</p>

<p>The scale of the biniou is usually <img style="width:234px; height:49px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img948.jpg" alt="" /><a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a>

and the single drone is tuned to the lower octave of the first
hole <img style="width:73px; height:35px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img949.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The more primitive biniou, still occasionally found in the
remote districts of Cornouailles and Morbihan, has a chaunter
with but five holes,<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a> giving part of the scale of D, the drone
being also tuned to D. The drone of the biniou is of boxwood,
handsomely inlaid with tin, and has a single or beating
reed hidden within the stock.</p>

<p>The word biniou or bignou (a Gallicized form), often erroneously
derived from <i>bigno, se renfler beaucoup</i>&mdash;an etymology
not supported by Breton dictionaries&mdash;is the Breton plural form
of <i>benvek</i>, instrument, tool, <i>i.e. binviou, binvijou</i>.<a name="fa3h" id="fa3h" href="#ft3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The word
is also found in the phrase, &ldquo;<i>Sac&rsquo;h ar biniou</i>&rdquo; (a biniou bag),
a bag used by weavers to hold their tools, spindles, &amp;c. The
biniou is still the traditional and popular instrument of the
Breton peasants of Cornouailles and Morbihan, and is almost
inseparable from the bombard (<i>q.v.</i>), which is no other than a
survival of the medieval musette, hautbois or chalémie, formerly
associated with the bag-pipe in western Europe (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oboe</a></span>).

<p><span class="bold">BINNEY, EDWARD WILLIAM<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (1812-1881), English geologist,
was born at Morton, in Nottinghamshire, in 1812. He was
articled to a solicitor in Chesterfield, and in 1836 settled at
Manchester. He retired soon afterwards from legal practice
and gave his chief attention to geological pursuits. He assisted
in 1838 in founding the Manchester Geological Society, of which
he was then chosen one of the honorary secretaries; he was
elected president in 1857, and again in 1865. He was also
successively secretary and president of the Literary and Philosophical
Society of Manchester. Working especially at the
Carboniferous and Permian rocks of the north of England, he
studied also the Drift deposits of Lancashire, and made himself
familiar with the geology of the country around Manchester.
On the Coal Measures in particular he became an acknowledged
authority, and his <i>Observations on the Structure of Fossil Plants
found in the Carboniferous Strata</i> (1868-1875) formed one of
the monographs of the Palaeontographical Society. His large
collection of fossils was placed in Owens College. He was elected
a fellow of the Royal Society in 1856. He died at Manchester
on the 19th of December 1881.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BINNEY, HORACE<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1780-1875), American lawyer, was born
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 4th of January 1780. He
graduated at Harvard College in 1797, and studied law in the
office of Jared Ingersoll (1749-1822), who had been a member
of the Constitutional convention of 1787, and who from 1791 to
1800 and again from 1811 to 1816 was the attorney-general of
Pennsylvania. Admitted to the bar in Philadelphia in 1800,
Binney practised with great success for half a century, and was
recognized as one of the leaders of the bar in the United States.
He served in the Pennsylvania legislature in 1806-1807, and was
a Whig member of the National House of Representatives from
1833 until 1835, ably defending the United States Bank, and in
general opposing the policy of President Andrew Jackson. His
most famous case, in which he was unsuccessfully opposed by
Daniel Webster, was the case of <i>Bidal</i> v. <i>Girard&rsquo;s Executors</i>,
which involved the disposition of the fortune of Stephen Girard
(<i>q.v.</i>). Binney&rsquo;s argument in this case greatly influenced the
interpretation of the law of charities. Binney made many public
addresses, the most noteworthy of which, entitled <i>Life and
Character of Chief Justice Marshall</i>, was published in 1835. He
also published <i>Leaders of the Old Bar of Philadelphia</i> (1858),
and an <i>Inquiry into the Formation of Washington&rsquo;s Farewell
Address</i> (1859); and during the Civil War he issued three
pamphlets (1861, 1862 and 1865), discussing the right of <i>habeas
corpus</i> under the American Constitution, and justifying President
Lincoln in his suspension of the writ.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BINNEY, THOMAS<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (1798-1874), English Congregationalist
divine, was born of Presbyterian parents at Newcastle-on-Tyne
in 1798, and educated at an ordinary day school. After spending
seven years in the employment of a bookseller he entered the
theological school at Wymondley, Herts, now incorporated in
New College, Hampstead. In 1829, after short pastorates at
Bedford (New Meeting) and Newport, Isle of Wight, he accepted
a call to the historic Weigh House chapel, London. Here he
became very popular, and it was found necessary to build a much
larger chapel on Fish Street Hill, to which the congregation
removed in 1834. An address delivered on the occasion of the
laying of the foundation stone was published, with an appendix
containing a strong attack on the influence of the Church of
England, which gave rise to a long and bitter controversy.
Throughout his whole career Binney was a vigorous opponent
of the state church principle, but those who simply classified him
as a narrow-minded political dissenter did him injustice. His
liberality of view and breadth of ecclesiastical sympathy entitle
him to rank on questions of Nonconformity among the most
distinguished of the school of Richard Baxter; and he maintained
friendly relations with many of the dignitaries of the
Established Church. He continued to discharge the duties of
the ministry until 1869, when he resigned. In 1845 he paid a
visit to Canada and the United States, and in 1857-1859 to the
Australian colonies. The university of Aberdeen conferred the
LL.D. degree on him in 1852, and he was twice chairman of the
Congregational Union of England and Wales.</p>

<p>Binney was the pioneer in a much-needed improvement of the
forms of service in Nonconformist churches, and gave a special
impulse to congregational psalmody by the publication of a book
entitled <i>The Service of Song in the House of the Lord</i>. Of numerous
other works the best-known is his <i>Is it Possible to Make the
Best of Both Worlds?</i> an expansion of a lecture delivered
to young men in Exeter Hall, which attained a circulation of
30,000 copies within a year of its publication. He wrote much
devotional verse, including the well-known hymn &ldquo;Eternal
Light! Eternal Light!&rdquo; His last sermon was preached in
November 1873, and after some months of suffering he died on
the 24th of February 1874. Dean Stanley assisted at his funeral
service in Abney Park cemetery.</p>

apparatus through which objects are viewed with both eyes.
In this article only those instruments will be considered in which
solid objects or <i>objects in space</i> are viewed; reference should be
made to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stereoscope</a></span> for the instruments in which
<i>plane</i> representations are offered to both eyes. The natural
vision is such that different central projections of the objects are
communicated to both eyes; the difference of the two perspective
representations arises from the fact that the projection centres
are laterally separated by an interval about equal to the distance
between the eyes (the inter-pupillary distance). Binocular instruments
should aid the natural spatial or stereoscopic vision,
or make it possible if the eyes fail. If the objects be so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page950" id="page950"></a>950</span>
distant that the two perspectives formed by the naked eye are
no more distinguished from each other, recourse may be had to
binocular telescopes and range-finders; and if the objects be
so small that, in order to observe details on them, we must bring
our eyes so close to the objects that they cannot accommodate
the images, recourse may be had to binocular microscopes and
magnifying glasses.</p>

<p>The construction of binocular instruments dates back over
several centuries, and has now been brought to great perfection.
The subject of their theory and history has been exhaustively
treated by M. von Rohr, <i>Die binokularen Instrumente</i> (Berlin,
1907), the first publication to present a complete account of
these instruments.</p>

<p><i>Binocular Instruments for Observation only.</i>&mdash;The first binocular
telescope, consisting of two telescopes placed side by side, was
constructed in 1608 by Johann Lipperhey, the inventor
of the ordinary or Dutch telescope. The subject was
<span class="sidenote">Telescope.</span>
next taken up by the monks. The Capuchin Antonius Maria
Schyrläus (Schyrl) de Rheita (1597-1660) described in 1645 the
construction of double terrestrial telescopes. Greater success
attended the efforts of the Capuchin
Chérubin d&rsquo;Orléans, who flourished
at about the same time, and constructed
large double telescopes of
the Dutch type of high magnification,
for use in war, and smaller
instruments of lower magnification;
these instruments were provided
with mechanism for adjusting to
the interval between the eyes of
the observer (fig. 1). After these
discoveries the subject received no
more attention until the 19th
century; no improvements of these
instruments are recorded in the
literature of the second half of the
18th century.</p>

<p>The re-invention of the Dutch
binocular telescope apparently dates
from 1823, and is to be assigned to
the Viennese optician, Johann Friedrich
Voigtländer (1779-1859); but
the credit of having placed these
instruments on the market probably
belongs to J.P. Lemière in Paris,
who, in 1825, took out a French patent for an improvement
of the Dutch double telescope. Lemière&rsquo;s instruments
were furnished with a common focusing arrangement, and
the adapting to the inter-pupillary distance was effected by
turning the two parallel telescopes round their common axis.
The development of this instrument was studied by opticians
for the remainder of the first half of the 19th century;
the last improvement apparently was made by P.G. Bardou
in 1854, and by H. Helmholtz in 1857 when he described
the telestereoscope (fig. 2) with telescopic magnification. By
utilizing the telescope with prism-inversion, devised in 1851
by Ignazio Porro (1795-1875), A.A. Boulanger succeeded in
producing a binocular of an entirely new type in 1859 (fig. 3).
But he overlooked the possibility of increasing the distance
between the objectives; Camille Nachet introduced this improvement
in 1875, but his instruments did not meet with much
popularity. This was probably due to the fact that, at this time,
the manufacture of the glass for the prisms was too difficult;
this was overcome by E. Abbe, after the founding of the glass-works
at Jena, who effected, independently of his predecessors,
the wider separation of the objectives
(fig. 4), and increased it
in the telestereoscope (fig. 5),
or relief telescope, in a manner
nearly approaching to Helmholtz&rsquo;s
proposal.</p>

<p>The first binocular microscope
was invented by the previously
mentioned Father
Chérubin, whose
instrument consisted of
two inverting systems, and consequently
gave a totally wrong
impression of depth, <i>i.e.</i> depressions
appeared as elevations,
<span class="sidenote">Microscope.</span>
and vice versa, or, as we must
say after Charles Wheatstone,
it presented a pseudoscopic impression;
this quality, however,
was not recognized by the
microscopists of the time. The
instrument subsequently fell into
complete neglect for nearly two
centuries, to be revived in 1852
by Charles Wheatstone, who has stated that he had previously
studied the problem; the publication of his views in his second
great paper &ldquo;On Binocular Vision,&rdquo;<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a> in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> for 1852,
undoubtedly stimulated the investigation of this instrument,
which was carried on with zeal and success more especially
in England and the United
States. In 1853 the American
J.L. Riddell (1807-1867)
devised his binocular microscope,
which contained the essentials of
Wheatstone&rsquo;s pseudoscope. F.H.
Wenham, another constructor,
did not at first succeed in avoiding
the pseudoscopic effect, but,
by the application of <i>refracting</i>
dividing prisms, he subsequently
arrived at orthoscopic representations
and continued the development
of the different
methods for producing micro-photographic
stereograms; this
was effected in the first case by
placing a diaphragm over one half of the objective for
each exposure, and in the second case by a suitable direction
of the illuminating pencil (fig. 6). Of greater benefit, however,
for stimulating interest in binocular microscopes, was
his invention of <i>reflecting</i> dividing prisms (fig. 7). Other
experiments, begun by Powell and Lealand, and developed
with greater skill by Wenham, were concerned with the
binocular vision of identical images. Such an impression
could not possibly be stereoscopic, and these experiments
led to the construction of a non-stereoscopic binocular microscope.
Of the other workers in this field mention may be made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page951" id="page951"></a>951</span>
of Alfred Nachet, who in 1853, and subsequently in 1863, brought
forward two forms of binocular microscope.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:519px; height:184px" src="images/img950e.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 5.</td></tr></table>

<p>The earliest stages of the development of the binocular
microscope had been always confined to those instruments with
<i>one</i> objective, in the immediate neighbourhood of which the
systems for dividing the pencil were placed. At a later date
attempts were made to separate the two halves of the objective
by modifying the eye-piece; this led to the construction of
stereoscopic eye-pieces, initiated by R.B. Tolles, E. Abbe and
A. Prazmowski. Of special importance is the work of Abbe;
although, as he himself has stated, his methods accidentally led
to the Wenham system, he certainly was far above his predecessors
in his theoretical treatment of the problem, and in the
perspicuity and clearness of his explanation. To him is also
due the re-establishment of the instruments, which Wenham
had abandoned by reason of too great technical difficulties
(fig. 8). The newest form of the binocular microscope is very
similar to the oldest form in which two completely separated
tubes were employed. The inventor, H.S. Greenough, employs
two systems for setting up the image, in order to avoid the
pseudoscopic effect. After experiments in the Zeiss works, the
erecting of Porro&rsquo;s prisms simultaneously permitted a convenient
adaptation to the eye-distance of the observer.</p>

<p>The first binocular magnifying glass or simple microscope
(German, <i>Lupe</i>) was devised by J.L. Riddell in 1853; in this
instrument (fig. 9) the pencil of light is transmitted
to the eyes by means of two pairs of parallel mirrors.
<span class="sidenote">Simple microscope.</span>
Of the many different improvements mention may
be made of A. Nachet&rsquo;s. H. Westien made use of two
Chevalier-Brücke&rsquo;s simple microscopes with their long working
distances in order to form an instrument in which the curvature
of the image was not entirely
avoided. Mention may also
be made of the binoculars of
K. Fritzsch (formerly Prokesch)
and E. Berger.</p>

<p><i>Binocular Instruments for Range-finding.</i>&mdash;For measuring
purposes binocular telescopes with parallel axes are
the only types employed. The measurement is effected by adjoining
to the space or interval to be measured some means of measurement
defined; for example, by a fixed scale which extends into
the space, or by a movable point (<i>Wandermarke</i>). This
instrument shows a transition to the stereoscope, inasmuch as the
scale or means of measurement is not directly observed, but
to each eye a plane representation is offered, just as in the
stereoscope; the space to be measured, on the other hand,
is portrayed in exactly the same way as in the double telescope.
The method for superposing the two spaces on one another
was deduced by Sir David Brewster in 1856, but he does not
appear to have dealt with the problem of range-finding. The
problem was attacked in 1861 by A. Rollet; later, in 1866,
E. Mach published a promising idea, and finally&mdash;independently
of the researches of his predecessors&mdash;Hektor de Grousilliers, in
partnership with the Zeiss firm (E. Abbe and C. Pulfrich),
constructed the first stereoscopic range-finder suitable for
practical use.</p>

<p>In a second letter, dated the 24th of October 1676, to Oldenburg,
Newton gave the train of reasoning by which he devised
the theorem.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning of my mathematical studies, when I was perusing
the works of the celebrated Dr Wallis, and considering the series
by the interpolation of which he exhibits the area of the circle and
hyperbola (for instance, in this series of curves whose common base
or axis is x, and the ordinates respectively
(1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">0/2</span>, (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">1/2</span>, (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">2/2</span>, (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">3/2</span>, &amp;c),
I perceived that if the areas of the alternate curves, which are
x, x &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>x<span class="sp">3</span>, x &minus; <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>x<span class="sp">3</span> + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>x<span class="sp">5</span>,
x &minus; <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>x<span class="sp">3</span> + <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>x<span class="sp">5</span> &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span>x<span class="sp">7</span>, &amp;c.,
could be interpolated, we should obtain the areas of the intermediate
ones, the first of which (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">1/2</span> is the area of the circle. Now in
order to [do] this, it appeared that in all the series the first term was
x; that the second terms <span class="spp">0</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>x³, <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>x³, <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>x³, &amp;c., were in arithmetical
progression; and consequently that the first two terms of all the series
to be interpolated would be
x &minus; ½x³/3, x &minus; <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>x³/3, x &minus; <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>x³/3, &amp;c.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the interpolation of the rest, I considered that the
denominators 1, 3, 5, &amp;c., were in arithmetical progression; and that
therefore only the numerical coefficients of the numerators were to
be investigated. But these in the alternate areas, which are given,
were the same with the figures of which the several powers of 11
consist, viz., of 11º, 11¹, 11², 11³, that is, the first 1; the
second, 1, 1; the third, 1, 2, 1,; the fourth 1, 3, 3, 1; and so on. I enquired
therefore how, in these series, the rest of the terms may be derived
from the first two being given; and I found that by putting m for
the second figure or term, the rest should be produced by the
continued multiplication of the terms of this series
(m &minus; 0)/1 × (m &minus; 1)/2 × (m &minus; 2)/3 ..., &amp;c. ...
This rule I therefore applied to the series to be interpolated.
And since, in the series for the circle, the second term was (½x³)/3, I put
m = ½.... And hence I found the required area of the circular segment to be
x &minus; (½x<span class="sp">3</span>)/3 &minus; (<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>x<span class="sp">5</span>)/5
&minus; (<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span>x<span class="sp">7</span>)/7, &amp;c. ...
And in the same manner might be
produced the interpolated areas of other curves; as also the
area of the hyperbola and the other alternates in this series
(1 + xx)<span class="sp">0/2</span>, (1 + xx)<span class="sp">1/2</span>, (1 + xx)<span class="sp">2/2</span>, &amp;c. ...
Having proceeded so far, I considered that
the terms (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">0/2</span>, (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">2/2</span>, (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">4/2</span>, (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">6/2</span>,
&amp;c., that is 1, 1 &minus; x<span class="sp">2</span>, 1 &minus; 2x<span class="sp">2</span> + x<span class="sp">4</span>, 1 &minus; 3x<span class="sp">2</span> + 3x<span class="sp">4</span> &minus; x<span class="sp">6</span>, &amp;c.,
might be interpolated in the same manner as the areas generated by
them, and for this, nothing more was required than to omit
the denominators 1, 3, 5, 7, &amp;c., in the terms expressing the
areas; that is, the coefficients of the terms of the quantity to
be interpolated (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">1/2</span> or (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">3/2</span>, or generally (1 &minus; xx)<span class="sp">m</span> will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page952" id="page952"></a>952</span>
be produced by the continued multiplication of this series
m × (m &minus; 1)/2 × (m &minus; 2)/3 × (m &minus; 3)/4 ... &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The binomial theorem was thus discovered as a development
of John Wallis&rsquo;s investigations in the method of <i>interpolation</i>.
Newton gave no proof, and it was in the <i>Ars Conjectandi</i> (1713)
that James Bernoulli&rsquo;s proof for positive integral values of the
exponent was first published, although Bernoulli must have
discovered it many years previously. A rigorous demonstration
was wanting for many years, Leonhard Euler&rsquo;s proof for negative
and fractional values being faulty, and was finally given by
Niels Heinrik Abel.</p>

<p>The <i>multi-</i> (or <i>poly-</i>) <i>nomial theorem</i> has for its object
the expansion of any power of a multinomial and was discussed
in 1697 by Abraham Demoivre (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Combinatorial Analysis</a></span>).</p>

almost equals in length the head and body together (from 28
to 33 inches). The fur is long and coarse, of a dull black hue
with a grey wash on the head and fore-limbs. In habits the
binturong is nocturnal and arboreal, inhabiting forests, and
living on small vertebrates, worms, insects and fruits. It is
said to be naturally fierce, but when taken young is easily tamed
and becomes gentle and playful.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIOGENESIS<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="bios">&#946;&#943;&#959;&#962;</span>, life, and <span class="grk" title="genesis">&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>,
generation, birth), a biological term for the theory according to
which each living organism, however simple, arises by a process of
budding, fission, spore-formation of sexual reproduction from
a parent organism. Under the heading of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abiogenesis</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>)
is discussed the series of steps by which the modern acceptance
of biogenesis and rejection of abiogenesis has been brought
about. No biological generalization rests on a wider series of
observations, or has been subjected to a more critical scrutiny
than that every living organism has come into existence from
a living portion or portions of a pre-existing organism. In
the articles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Reproduction</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Heredity</a></span> the details of the
relations between parent and offspring are discussed. There
remains for treatment here a curious collateral issue of the
theory. It is within common observation that parent and
offspring are alike: that the new organism resembles that from
which it has come into existence: in fine, biogenesis is
homogenesis. Every organism takes origin from a parent organism
of the same kind. The conception of homogenesis, however,
does not imply an absolute similarity between parent and
organism. In the first place, the normal life-cycle of plants and
animals exhibits what is known as alternation of generations, so
that any individual in the chain may resemble its grand-parent
and its grand-child, and differ markedly from its parent and child.
Next, any organism may pass through a series of free-living
larval stages, so that the new organism at first resembles its
parent only very remotely, corresponding to an early stage in the
life-history of that parent. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Embryology</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Larval Forms</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Reproduction</a></span>.) Finally, the conception of homogenesis
does not exclude the differences between parent and offspring
that continually occur, forming the material for the slow
alteration of stocks in the course of evolution (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Variation
and Selection</a></span>). Homogenesis means simply that such organism
comes into existence directly from a parent organism of the same
race, and hence of the same species, sub-species, genus and so
forth.</p>

<p>From time to time there have been observers who have
maintained a belief in the opposite theory, to which the name
heterogenesis has been given. According to the latter theory, the
offspring of a given organism may be utterly different from itself,
so that a known animal may give rise to another known animal
of a different race, species, genus, or even family, or to a plant,
or vice versa. The most extreme cases of this belief is the
well-known fable of the &ldquo;barnacle-geese,&rdquo; an illustrated account
of which was printed in an early volume of the Royal Society of
London. Buds of a particular tree growing near the sea were
described as producing barnacles, and these, falling into the
water, were supposed to develop into geese. The whole story
was an imaginary embroidery of the facts that barnacles attach
themselves to submerged timber and that a species of goose
is known as the bernicle goose. In modern times the exponents
of heterogenesis have limited themselves to cases of microscopic
animals and plants, and in most cases, the observations that
they have brought forward have been explained by minuter
observation as cases of parasitism. No serious observer,
acquainted with modern microscopic technical methods, has
been able to confirm the explanation of their observations
given by the few modern believers in heterogenesis.</p>

writing), that form of history which is applied, not to races or
masses of men, but to an individual. The earliest use of the word
<span class="grk" title="biographia">&#946;&#953;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span> is attributed to Damascius, a Greek writer of the
beginning of the 6th century, and in Latin <i>biographia</i> was used,
but in English no earlier employment of the word, &ldquo;biography&rdquo; has
been traced than that of Dryden in 1683, who uses it to describe
the literary work of Plutarch, &ldquo;the history of particular men&rsquo;s
lives.&rdquo; It is obvious that this definition is necessary, for biography
is not the record of &ldquo;life&rdquo; in general, but of the life of a single
person. The idea of the distinction between this and history is
a modern thing; we speak of &ldquo;antique biography,&rdquo; but it is
doubtful whether any writer of antiquity, even Plutarch, clearly
perceived its possible existence as an independent branch of
literature. All of them, and Plutarch certainly, considered the
writing of a man&rsquo;s life as an opportunity for celebrating, in his
person, certain definite moral qualities. It was in these, and not
in the individual characteristics of the man, that his interest as a
subject of biography resided.</p>

<p>The true conception of biography, therefore, as the faithful
portrait of a soul in its adventures through life, is very modern.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page953" id="page953"></a>953</span>
We may question whether it existed, save in rare and
accidental instances, until the 17th century. The personage
described was, in earlier times, treated either from the
philosophical or from the historical point of view. In the former case,
rhetoric inevitably clouded the definiteness of the picture; the
object was to produce a grandiose moral effect, to clothe the
subject with all the virtues or with all the vices; to make his
career a splendid example or else a solemn warning. The
consequence is that we have to piece together unconsidered
incidents and the accidental record of features in order to obtain
an approximate estimate. We may believe, for instance, that
a faithful and unprejudiced study of the emperor Julian, from
the life, would be a very different thing from the impression left
upon us by the passions of Cyril or of Theodoret. In considering
what biography, in its pure sense, ought to be, we must insist on
what it is not. It is not a philosophical treatise nor a polemical
pamphlet. It is not, even, a portion of the human contemporary
chronicle. Broad views are entirely out of place in biography,
and there is perhaps no greater literary mistake than to attempt
what is called the &ldquo;Life and Times&rdquo; of a man. In an adequate
record of the &ldquo;times,&rdquo; the man is bound to sink into significance;
even a &ldquo;Life and Times&rdquo; of Napoleon I. would be an impossible
task. History deals with fragments of the vast roll of events;
it must always begin abruptly and close in the middle of affairs;
it must always deal, impartially, with a vast number of persons.
Biography is a study sharply defined by two definite events,
birth and death. It fills its canvas with one figure, and other
personages, however great in themselves, must always be
subsidiary to the central hero. The only remnant of the old
rhetorical purpose of &ldquo;lives&rdquo; which clearer modern purpose
can afford to retain is the relative light thrown on military or
intellectual or social genius by the achievements of the selected
subject. Even this must be watched with great care, lest the
desire to illuminate that genius, and make it consistent, should
lead the biographer to glose over frailties or obscure irregularities.
In the old &ldquo;lives&rdquo; of great men, this is precisely what was done.
If the facts did not lend themselves to the great initial thesis,
so much the worse for them. They must be ignored or falsified,
since the whole object of the work was to &ldquo;teach a lesson,&rdquo; to
magnify a certain tendency of conduct. It was very difficult
to persuade the literary world that, whatever biography is, it is
not an opportunity for panegyric or invective, and the lack of
this perception destroys our faith in most of the records of
personal life in ancient and medieval times. It is impossible to
avoid suspecting that Suetonius loaded his canvas with black
in order to excite hatred against the Roman emperors; it is still
more difficult to accept more than one page in three of the
stories of the professional hagiographers. As long as it was a
pious merit to deform the truth, biography could not hope to
flourish. It appears to have originally asserted itself when
the primitive instinct of sympathy began to have free play,
that is to say, not much or often before the 17th century.
Moreover, the peculiar curiosity which legitimate biography
satisfies is essentially a modern thing; and presupposes our
observation of life not unduly clouded by moral passion or
prejudice.</p>

<p>Among the ancients, biography was not specifically cultivated
until comparatively later times. The lost &ldquo;Lives&rdquo; of Critias
were probably political pamphlets. We meet first with deliberate
biography in Xenophon&rsquo;s memoirs of Socrates, a work of epoch-making
value. Towards the close of the 1st century, Plutarch
wrote one of the most fascinating books in the world&rsquo;s literature,
his <i>Parallel Lives</i> of 46 Greeks and Romans. In later Greek,
the <i>Life of Apollonius of Tyana</i> was written by Philostratus, who
also produced a <i>Lives of the Sophists</i>. In the 3rd century,
Diogenes Laertius compiled a <i>Lives of the Philosophers</i>, which is
of greater interest than a <i>Lives of the Sophists</i> composed a
hundred years later by Eunapius. Finally in the 10th century,
Suidas added a biographical section to his celebrated <i>Lexicon</i>.
In Latin literature, the earliest biography we meet with is the
fragment of the <i>Illustrious Men</i> of Cornelius Nepos. Memoirs
began to be largely written at the close of the Augustan age,
but these, like the <i>Life of Alexander the Great</i>, by Q. Curtius
Rufus, were rather historical than biographical. Tacitus
composed a life of his father-in-law, Agricola; this is a work
of the most elegant and stately beauty. Suetonius was the
author of several biographical compilations, of which the <i>Lives
of the Twelve Caesars</i> is the best-known; this was produced in
the year 120. Marius Maximus, in the 4th century, continued
the series of emperors down to Heliogabalus, but his work has
not been preserved. The <i>Augustan History</i>, finished under
Constantine, takes its place, and was concluded and edited by
Flavius Vopiscus.</p>

<p>Biography hardly begins to exist in English literature until
the close of the reign of Henry VIII. William Roper (1496-1578)
wrote a touching life of his father-in-law, Sir Thomas More,
and George Cavendish (1500-1561?), a memoir of Cardinal
Wolsey which is a masterpiece of liveliness and grace. It is
with these two works, both of which remained in manuscript
until the 17th century, that biography in England begins. The
lives of English writers compiled by John Bale (1495-1563) are
much more primitive and slight. John Leland (d. 1552) and
John Pits (1560-1616) were antiquaries who affected a species
of biography. In the early part of the 17th century, the absence
of the habit of memoir writing extremely impoverishes our
knowledge of the illustrious authors of the age, of none of whom
there are preserved such records as our curiosity would delight
in. The absence of any such chronicle was felt, and two writers,
Thomas Heywood and Sir Aston Cokayne, proposed to write
lives of the poets of their time. Unfortunately they never
carried their plans into execution. The pioneer of deliberate
English biography was Izaak Walton, who, in 1640, published a
<i>Life of Donne</i>, followed in 1651 by that of <i>Sir Henry Wotton</i>,
in 1665 by that of <i>Richard Hooker</i>, in 1670 by that of <i>George
Herbert</i>, and in 1678 by that of <i>Dr Robert Saunderson</i>. These
five reprinted, under the title of <i>Walton&rsquo;s Lives</i>, were not only
charming in themselves, but the forerunners of a whole class of
English literature. Meanwhile, Fuller was preparing his <i>History
of the Worthies of England</i>, which appeared after his death, in
1662, and John Aubrey (1626-1697) was compiling his <i>Minutes
of Lives</i>, which show such a perfect comprehension of the personal
element that should underlie biography; these have only in
our own days been completely given to the public. Edward,
Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1583-1648), wrote a brilliant
autobiography, first printed in 1764; that of Anne Harrison,
Lady Fanshawe (1625-1680), remained unknown until 1829. A very
curious essay in biography is the memoir of Colonel John
Hutchinson, written by his widow, Lucy, between 1664 and 1671.
Margaret Lucas, duchess of Newcastle (1624?-1674), wrote her
own life (1656) and that of her duke (1667). The <i>Athenae
Oxonienses</i> of Anthony à Wood (1632-1695) was a complicated
celebration of the wit, wisdom and learning of Oxford notabilities
since the Reformation. In 1668 Thomas Sprat (1635-1713)
wrote a <i>Life of Cowley</i>, which was very much admired and
which exercised for many years a baneful influence on British
biography. Sprat considered that all familiar anecdote and
picturesque detail should be omitted in the composition of a
memoir, and that moral effect and a solemn vagueness should
be aimed at. The celebrated funeral orations of Jeremy Taylor
were of the same order of eloquence, and the wind of those
grandiose compositions destroyed the young shoot of genuine
and simple biography which had budded in Walton and Aubrey.</p>

<p>From this time forth, for more than half a century, English
biography became a highly artificial and rhetorical thing,
lacking all the salient features of honest portraiture. William
Oldys (1696-1761) was the first to speak out boldly; in 1747,
in the preface to the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, he pointed out
&ldquo;the cruelty, we might even say the impiety, of sacrificing the
glory of great characters to trivial circumstances and mere
conveniency,&rdquo; and attacked the timid and scrupulous superficiality
of those who undertook to write lives of eminent men, while
omitting everything which gave definition to the portrait. In
1753 the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, which bore the name of Theophilus
Cibber (1703-1758), but was mainly written by Robert Shiels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page954" id="page954"></a>954</span>
(d. 1753), gave a great deal of valuable information with regard
to the personal adventures of our writers. Dr Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Life
of Savage</i> (1744), though containing some passages of extreme
interest, was a work of imperfect form, but Mason&rsquo;s <i>Life and
Letters of Gray</i> (1774) marks a great advance in the art of
biography. This was the earliest memoir in which correspondence
of a familiar kind was used to illustrate and to expand the narrative,
and Mason&rsquo;s <i>Gray</i> is really the pioneer of almost all modern
English biography. For the first time it was now admitted that
letters to intimate friends, not written with a view to publication,
might be used with advantage to illustrate the real character
of the writer. Boswell, it is certain, availed himself of Mason&rsquo;s
example, while improving upon it, and in 1791 he published
his <i>Life of Dr Samuel Johnson</i>, which is the most interesting
example of biography existing in English, or perhaps in any
language.</p>

<p>As soon as the model of Boswell became familiar to biographers,
it could no longer be said that any secret in the art was left
unknown to them, and the biographies of the 19th century
are all more or less founded upon the magnificent type of the
<i>Life of Johnson</i>. But few have even approached it in courage,
picturesqueness or mastery of portraiture. In the next generation
Southey&rsquo;s lives of <i>Nelson</i> (1813) and <i>John Wesley</i> (1820)
at once became classics; but the pre-eminent specimen of
early 19-century biography is Lockhart&rsquo;s superb <i>Life of
Sir Walter Scott</i> (1837-1838). The biographies of the 19th
century are far too numerous to be mentioned here in detail;
in the various articles dedicated to particular men and women
in this Encyclopaedia, the date and authorship of the authoritative
life of each person will in most cases be found appended.
Towards the close of the century there was unquestionably
an excess, and even an abuse, in the habit of biography. It
became the custom a few years or even months after the decease
of an individual who had occupied a passing place in the eyes of
the public, to issue a &ldquo;Life&rdquo; of him; in many cases such
biography was a labour of utter supererogation. But the custom
has become general, and it is very unlikely, notwithstanding
the ephemeral interest of readers in the majority of the subjects,
that it will ever go out of fashion, for it directly indulges both
vanity and sentiment. What is true of Great Britain is true,
though in less measure, of all other modern nations, and it is not
necessary here to deal with more than the early manifestations
of biography in the principal European literatures.</p>

<p>To Switzerland appears due the honour of having given birth
to the earliest biographical dictionary ever compiled, the
<i>Bibliotheca Universalis</i> of Konrad Gesner (1516-1565), published
at Zürich in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, from 1545 to 1549. A very rare
work, by a writer of the greatest obscurity, the <i>Prosopographia</i>
of Verdier de Vauprivas, published at Lyons in 1573,
professed to deal with the lives of all illustrious persons who
had flourished since the beginning of the world.</p>

<p>In medieval and renaissance France there existed numerous
memoirs and histories, such as those of Brantôme, into which
the lives of great men were inserted, and in which a biographical
character was given to studies of virtue and valour, or of the
reverse. But the honour of being the earliest deliberate contribution
to biography is generally given to the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>,
compiled by the Bollandists, the first volume of which appeared
in 1653. This was the first biographical dictionary compiled in
Europe, and its publication produced a great sensation. It
was confined to the lives of saints and martyrs, but in 1674
Louis Moréri, in his <i>Grand Dictionnaire</i>, included a biographical
section of a general character. But the earliest biographical
dictionary which had anything of a modern form was the celebrated
<i>Dictionnaire historique et critique</i> of Pierre Bayle, in
1696; the lives in this great work, however, are too often used
as mere excuses for developing the philosophical and controversial
views of the author; they are nevertheless the result of genuine
research and have a true biographical view. The <i>Dictionnaire</i>
was translated into English in 1734, and had a wide influence
in creating a legitimate interest in biography in England.</p>

<p>In Italian literature, biography does not take a prominent
place until the 15th century. <i>The Lives of Illustrious
Florentines</i>, in which a valuable memoir of Dante occurs, was
written in Latin by Filippo Villani. Vespasiano da Bistrici
(1421-1498) compiled a set of biographies of his contemporaries,
which are excellent of their kind. The so-called <i>Life of Castruccio
Castracani</i>, by Machiavelli, is hardly a biography, but a
brilliant essay on the ideals of statecraft. Paolo Giovio (1483-1552)
wrote the lives of poets and soldiers whom he had known.
All these attempts, however, seem insignificant by the side of
the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini (1501-1571), confessedly
one of the most entertaining works of the world&rsquo;s literature.
A great deal of biography is scattered throughout the historical
compilations of the Italian renaissance, and the <i>Lives of the
Artists</i>, by Giorgio Vasari (1512-1574), is a storehouse of
anecdotes admirably told. We find nothing else that requires
special mention till we reach the memoir-writers of the 18th
century, with the autobiographies of Count Carlo Gozzi and
Alfieri; and on the whole, Italy, although adopting in the
19th century the habit of biography, has rarely excelled in it.</p>

<p>In Spanish literature Fernán Pérez de Guzmán (1378-1460), with
great originality, enshrined, in his <i>Generations and Likenesses</i>,
a series of admirable literary portraits; he has been called
the Plutarch of Spain. But, in spite of numerous lives of saints,
poets and soldiers, Spanish literature has not excelled in
biography, nor has it produced a single work of this class which is
universally read. In Germany there is little to record before
the close of the 18th century.</p>

<p>In the course of the 19th century a new thing in biography
was invented, in the shape of dictionaries of national biography.
Of these, the first which was carried to a successful conclusion
was the Swedish (1835-1857), which occupied 23 volumes.
This dictionary was followed by the Dutch (1852-1878), in 24
volumes; the Austrian (1856-1891), in 35 volumes; the Belgian
(which was begun in 1866); the German (1875-1900), in 45
volumes; and others, representing nearly all the countries of
Europe. England was behind the competitors named above,
but when she joined the ranks a work was produced the value
of which can hardly be exaggerated. The project was started
in 1882 by the publisher George Smith (1824-1901), who consulted
Mr (afterwards Sir) Leslie Stephen. The first volume of
the English <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> was published
on the 1st of January 1885, under Stephen&rsquo;s editorship. A
volume was published quarterly, with complete punctuality
until Midsummer 1900, when volume 63 closed the work, which
was presently extended by the issue of three supplementary
volumes. In May 1891 Leslie Stephen resigned the editorship
and was succeeded by Mr Sidney Lee, who conducted the work
to its prosperous close, bringing it up to the death of Queen
Victoria. The <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> contains the
lives of more than 30,000 persons, and has proved of inestimable
service in elucidating the private annals of the British people.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIOLOGY<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="bios">&#946;&#943;&#959;&#962;</span>, life). The biological sciences are those
which deal with the phenomena manifested by living matter;
and though it is customary and convenient to group apart
such of these phenomena as are termed mental, and such
of them as are exhibited by men in society, under the heads of
psychology and sociology, yet it must be allowed that no
natural boundary separates the subject matter of the latter
sciences from that of biology. Psychology is inseparably linked
with physiology; and the phases of social life exhibited by
animals other than man, which sometimes curiously foreshadow
human policy, fall strictly within the province of the biologist.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the biological sciences are sharply marked
off from the abiological, or those which treat of the phenomena
manifested by not-living matter, in so far as the properties of
living matter distinguish it absolutely from all other kinds of
things, and as the present state of knowledge furnishes us with
no link between the living and the not-living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page955" id="page955"></a>955</span></p>

<p>These distinctive properties of living matter are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Its <i>chemical composition</i>&mdash;containing, as it
invariably does, one or more forms of a complex compound of carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen and nitrogen, the so-called protein or albumin
(which has never yet been obtained except as a product
<span class="sidenote">The properties of living matter.</span>
of living bodies), united with a large proportion
of water, and forming the chief constituent of a substance
which, in its primary unmodified state, is known as
<i>protoplasm</i>.</p>

<p>2. Its <i>universal disintegration and waste by oxidation; and
its concomitant reintegration by the intussusception of new matter</i>.</p>

<p>A process of waste resulting from the decomposition of the
molecules of the protoplasm, in virtue of which they break up
into more highly oxidated products, which cease to form any
part of the living body, is a constant concomitant of life. There
is reason to believe that carbonic acid is always one of these
waste products, while the others contain the remainder of the
carbon, the nitrogen, the hydrogen and the other elements which
may enter into the composition of the protoplasm.</p>

<p>The new matter taken in to make good this constant loss is
either a ready-formed protoplasmic material, supplied by some
other living being, or it consists of the elements of protoplasm,
united together in simpler combinations, which consequently
have to be built up into protoplasm by the agency of the living
matter itself. In either case, the addition of molecules to those
which already existed takes place, not at the surface of the living
mass, but by interposition between the existing molecules of
the latter. If the processes of disintegration and of reconstruction
which characterize life balance one another, the size of the
mass of living matter remains stationary, while, if the reconstructive
process is the more rapid, the living body <i>grows</i>. But
the increase of size which constitutes growth is the result of a
process of molecular intussusception, and therefore differs
altogether from the process of growth by accretion, which may
be observed in crystals and is effected purely by the external
addition of new matter&mdash;so that, in the well-known aphorism
of Linnaeus, the word &ldquo;grow&rdquo; as applied to stones signifies a
totally different process from what is called &ldquo;growth&rdquo; in plants
and animals.</p>

<p>3. Its <i>tendency to undergo cyclical changes</i>.</p>

<p>In the ordinary course of nature, all living matter proceeds
from pre-existing living matter, a portion of the latter being
detached and acquiring an independent existence. The new
form takes on the characters of that from which it arose; exhibits
the same power of propagating itself by means of an offshoot;
and, sooner or later, like its predecessor, ceases to live, and
is resolved into more highly oxidated compounds of its elements.</p>

<p>Thus an individual living body is not only constantly changing
its substance, but its size and form are undergoing continual
modifications, the end of which is the death and decay of that
individual; the continuation of the kind being secured by the
detachment of portions which tend to run through the same cycle
of forms as the parent. No forms of matter which are either
not living, or have not been derived from living matter, exhibit
these three properties, nor any approach to the remarkable
phenomena defined under the second and third heads. But in
addition to these distinctive characters, living matter has some
other peculiarities, the chief of which are the dependence of all
its activities upon moisture and upon heat, within a limited
range of temperature, and the fact that it usually possesses a
certain structure or organization.</p>

<p>As has been said, a large proportion of water enters into the
composition of all living matter; a certain amount of drying
arrests vital activity, and the complete abstraction
of this water is absolutely incompatible with either
<span class="sidenote">Life conditioned by moisture.</span>
actual or potential life. But many of the simpler
forms of life may undergo desiccation to such an
extent as to arrest their vital manifestations and convert them
into the semblance of not-living matter, and yet remain potentially
alive. That is to say, on being duly moistened they return
to life again. And this revivification may take place after
months, or even years, of arrested life.</p>

<p>The properties of living matter are intimately related to
temperature. Not only does exposure to heat sufficient to
coagulate protein matter destroy life, by demolishing
the molecular structure upon which life depends; but
<span class="sidenote">Life conditioned by temperature.</span>
all vital activity, all phenomena of nutritive growth,
movement and reproduction are possible only between
certain limits of temperature. These limits may be
set down as from a little above the freezing point of water to a
little below the boiling point It is to be noted, however,
that these limits apply to the living matter itself, and many of
the apparent exceptions are due to cases in which the living
matter is enclosed in protective wrappings capable of resisting
heat and cold. In many low organisms, such as the spores of
bacteria, the thick, non-conducting wall may preserve the
living protoplasm from subjection to external temperatures
below freezing point, or above boiling point, but all the evidence
goes to show that applications of such cold or heat, if prolonged
or arranged so as to penetrate to the living matter, destroy life.
In warm-blooded animals, such as birds and mammals, protective
mechanisms for the regulation of temperature enable them to
endure exposure to extreme heat or cold, but in such cases the
actually living cells do not appreciably rise or fall in temperature.
A variation of a very few degrees in the blood itself produces
death.</p>

<p>Recent investigations point to the conclusion that the immediate
cause of the arrest of vitality, in the first place, and of its
destruction, in the second, is the coagulation of certain substances
in the protoplasm, and that the latter contains various coagulable
matters, which solidify at different temperatures. And it
remains to be seen, how far the death of any form of living matter,
at a given temperature, depends on the destruction of its fundamental
substance at that heat, and how far death is brought
about by the coagulation of merely accessory compounds.</p>

<p>It may be safely said of all those living things which are large
enough to enable us to trust the evidence of microscopes, that
they are heterogeneous optically, and that their
different parts, and especially the surface layer, as
<span class="sidenote">Life and organization.</span>
contrasted with the interior, differ physically and
chemically; while, in most living things, mere heterogeneity
is exchanged for a definite structure, whereby the body
is distinguished into visibly different parts, which possess different
powers or functions. Living things which present this visible
structure are said to be <i>organized</i>; and so widely does organization
obtain among living beings, that <i>organized</i> and <i>living</i> are
not unfrequently used as if they were terms of co-extensive
applicability. This, however, is not exactly accurate, if it be
thereby implied that all living things have a visible organization,
as there are numerous forms of living matter of which it cannot
properly be said that they possess either a definite structure or
permanently specialized organs: though, doubtless, the simplest
particle of living matter must possess a highly complex molecular
structure, which is far beyond the reach of vision.</p>

<p>The broad distinctions which, as a matter of fact, exist between
every known form of living substance and every other component
of the material world, justify the separation of the biological
sciences from all others. But it must not be supposed that the
differences between living and not-living matter are such as to
justify the assumption that the forces at work in the one are
different from those which are to be met with in the other.
Considered apart from the phenomena of consciousness, the
phenomena of life are all dependent upon the working of the
same physical and chemical forces as those which are active in
the rest of the world. It may be convenient to use the terms
&ldquo;vitality&rdquo; and &ldquo;vital force&rdquo; to denote the causes of certain
great groups of natural operations, as we employ the names of
&ldquo;electricity&rdquo; and &ldquo;electrical force&rdquo; to denote others; but it
ceases to be proper to do so, if such a name implies the absurd
assumption that &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; and &ldquo;vitality&rdquo; are entities
playing the part of efficient causes of electrical or vital
phenomena. A mass of living protoplasm is simply a molecular
machine of great complexity, the total results of the working
of which, or its vital phenomena, depend&mdash;on the one hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page956" id="page956"></a>956</span>
upon its construction, and, on the other, upon the energy supplied
to it; and to speak of &ldquo;vitality&rdquo; as anything but the name of
a series of operations is as if one should talk of the &ldquo;horologity&rdquo;
of a clock.</p>

<p>Living matter, or protoplasm and the products of its metamorphosis,
<span class="sidenote">Classification of the phenomena of life.</span>
may be regarded under four aspects:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It has a certain external and internal form, the
latter being more usually called structure;</p>

<p>2. It occupies a certain position in space and in time;</p>

<p>3. It is the subject of the operation of certain forces in virtue
of which it undergoes internal changes, modifies external objects,
and is modified by them; and</p>

<p>4. Its form, place and powers are the effects of certain causes.</p>

<p>In correspondence with these four aspects of its subject, biology
is logically divisible into four chief subdivisions&mdash;I. <span class="sc">Morphology</span>;
II. <span class="sc">Distribution</span>; III. <span class="sc">Physiology</span>; IV. <span class="sc">Aetiology</span>.</p>

<p>Various accidental circumstances, however, have brought it
about that the actual distribution of scientific work does not
correspond with the logical subdivisions of biology. The difference
in technical methods and the historical evolution of teaching
posts (for in all civilized countries the progress of biological
knowledge has been very closely associated with the existence
of institutions for the diffusion of knowledge and for professional
education) have been the chief contributory causes to this
practical confusion. Details of the morphology of plants will
be found in the articles relating to the chief groups of plants,
those of animals in the corresponding articles on groups of
animals, while the classification of animals adopted in this work
will be found in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zoology</a></span>. Distribution is treated
of under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zoological Distribution</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plankton</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Palaeontology</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plants</a></span>: <i>Distribution</i>. <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Physiology</a></span> and its allied
articles deal with the subject generally and in relation to man,
while the special physiology of plants is dealt with in a section
of the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plants</a></span>. Aetiology is treated of under the heading
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Evolution</a></span>. But practical necessity has given rise to the
existence of many other divisions; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cytology</a></span>, for the
structure of cells; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Embryology</a></span>, for the development of

<p><span class="bold">BION,<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> Greek bucolic poet, was born at Phlossa near Smyrna,
and flourished about 100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The account formerly given of
him, that he was the contemporary and imitator of Theocritus,
the friend and tutor of Moschus, and lived about 280 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, is now
generally regarded as incorrect. W. Stein (<i>De Moschi et Bionis
aetate</i>, Tübingen, 1893) puts Bion, chiefly on metrical grounds,
in the first half of the 1st century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Nothing is known of him
except that he lived in Sicily. The story that he died of poison,
administered to him by some jealous rivals, who afterwards
suffered the penalty of their crime, is probably only an invention
of the author of the <span class="grk" title="Epitaphios Bionos">&#7960;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#940;&#966;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#914;&#943;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Moschus</a></span>). Although
his poems are included in the general class of bucolic poetry, the
remains show little of the vigour and truthfulness to nature
characteristic of Theocritus. They breathe an exaggerated
sentimentality, and show traces of the overstrained reflection
frequently observable in later developments of pastoral poetry.
The longest and best of them is the <i>Lament for Adonis</i>
(<span class="grk" title="Epitaphios Adonidos">&#7960;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#940;&#966;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7944;&#948;&#974;&#957;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>). It refers to the first day of the festival
of Adonis (<i>q.v.</i>), on which the death of the favourite of Aphrodite was
lamented, thus forming an introduction to the <i>Adoniazusae</i> of
Theocritus, the subject of which is the second day, when the
reunion of Adonis and Aphrodite was celebrated. Fragments of
his other pieces are preserved in Stobaeus; the epithalamium
of Achilles and Deidameia is not his.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Bion and Moschus have been edited separately by G. Hermann (1849) and C. Ziegler
(Tübingen, 1869), the <i>Epitaphios Adonidos</i> by H.L. Ahrens (1854) and E.
Hiller in <i>Beiträge zur Textegeschichte der griechischen Bukoliker</i> (1888).
Bion&rsquo;s poems are generally included in the editions of Theocritus. There are
English translations by J. Banks (1853) in Bohn&rsquo;s <i>Classical Library</i>,

<p><span class="bold">BION,<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> of Borysthenes (Olbia), in Sarmatia, Greek moralist
and philosopher, flourished in the first half of the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
He was of low origin, his mother being a courtesan and his
father a dealer in salt fish, with which he combined the
occupation of smuggling. Bion, when a young man, was sold as a
slave to a rhetorician, who gave him his freedom and made him
his heir. After the death of his patron, Bion went to Athens to
study philosophy. Here he attached himself in succession to
the Academy, the Cynics, the Cyrenaics and the Peripatetics.
One of his teachers was the Cyrenaic Theodorus, called &ldquo;the
atheist,&rdquo; whose influence is clearly shown in Bion&rsquo;s attitude
towards the gods. After the manner of the sophists of the
period, Bion travelled through Greece and Macedonia, and was
admitted to the literary circle at the court of Antigonus Gonatas.
He subsequently taught philosophy at Rhodes and died at Chalcis
in Euboea. His life was written by Diogenes Laertius. Bion
was essentially a popular writer, and in his <i>Diatribae</i> he
satirized the follies of mankind in a manner calculated to appeal to
the sympathies of a low-class audience. While eulogizing poverty
and philosophy, he attacked the gods, musicians, geometricians,
astrologers, and the wealthy, and denied the efficacy of prayer.
His influence is distinctly traceable in succeeding writers, <i>e.g.</i>
in the satires of Menippus. Horace (<i>Epistles</i>, ii. 2. 60) alludes
to his satires and caustic wit (<i>sal nigrum</i>). An idea of his writings
can be gathered from the fragments of Teles, a cynic philosopher
who lived towards the end of the 3rd century, and who made
great use of them. Specimens of his apophthegms may be found
in Diogenes Laertius and the florilegium of Stobaeus, while there
are traces of his influence in Seneca.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIOT, JEAN BAPTISTE<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (1774-1862), French physicist, was
born at Paris on the 21st of April 1774. After serving for a
short time in the artillery, he was appointed in 1797 professor
of mathematics at Beauvais, and in 1800 he became professor of
physics at the Collège de France, through the influence of Laplace,
from whom he had sought and obtained the favour of reading
the proof sheets of the <i>Mécanique céleste</i>. Three years
later, at an unusually early age, he was elected a member of
the Academy of Sciences, and in 1804 he accompanied Gay
Lussac on the first balloon ascent undertaken for scientific
purposes. In 1806 he was associated with F.J.D. Arago, with
whom he had already carried out investigations on the refractive
properties of different gases, in the measurement of an arc of
the meridian in Spain, and in subsequent years he was engaged
in various other geodetic determinations. In 1814 he was made
chevalier and in 1849 commander, of the Legion of Honour.
He failed in his ambition of becoming perpetual secretary of
the Academy of Sciences, but was somewhat consoled by his
election as a member of the French Academy in 1856. He died
in Paris on the 3rd of February 1862. His researches extended
to almost every branch of physical science, but his most
important work was of an optical character. He was especially
interested in questions relating to the polarization of light,
and his observations in this field, which gained him the Rumford
medal of the Royal Society in 1840, laid the foundations of the
polarimetric analysis of sugar.</p>

<p>Biot was an extremely prolific writer, and besides a great
number of scientific memoirs, biographies, &amp;c., his published
works include:
<i>Analyse de la mécanique céleste de M. Laplace</i> (1801);
<i>Traité analytique des courbes et des surfaces du second degré</i> (1802);
<i>Recherches sur l&rsquo;intégration des équations différentielles partielles
et sur les vibrations des surfaces</i> (1803);
<i>Traité de physique</i> (1816);
<i>Recueil d&rsquo;observations géodésiques, astronomiques et physiques
exécutées en Espagne et Écosse</i>, with Arago (1821);
<i>Mémoire sur la vraie constitution de l&rsquo;atmosphère terrestre</i> (1841);
<i>Traité élementaire d&rsquo;astronomie physique</i> (1805);
<i>Recherches sur</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page957" id="page957"></a>957</span>

<i>Recherches sur l&rsquo;ancienne astronomie chinoise</i> (1840);
<i>Études sur l&rsquo;astronomie indienne et sur l&rsquo;astronomie chinoise</i> (1862);
<i>Essai sur l&rsquo;histoire générale des sciences pendant la Révolution</i> (1803);
<i>Discours sur Montaigne</i> (1812);
<i>Lettres sur l&rsquo;approvisionnement de Paris
et sur le commerce des grains</i> (1835);
<i>Mélanges scientifiques et littéraires</i> (1858).</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Edouard Constant Biot</span> (1803-1850), after amassing a competence
from railway engineering, turned to the study of Chinese subjects, and
published <i>Causes de l&rsquo;abolition de l&rsquo;esclavage ancien en occident</i> (1840);
<i>Dictionnaire des noms anciens et modernes des villes et des arrondissements
compris dans l&rsquo;empire chinois</i> (1842);

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIOTITE,<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> an important rock-forming mineral belonging to
the group of micas (<i>q.v.</i>). The name was given by J.F.L. Hausmann
in 1847 in honour of the French physicist, J.B. Biot,
who in 1816 found the magnesia-micas to be optically uniaxial or
nearly so. The magnesia-micas are now referred to the species
biotite and phlogopite, which differ in that the former contains
a considerable but widely varying amount of iron. Biotite is
an orthosilicate of aluminium, magnesium, ferrous and ferric
iron, potassium and basic hydrogen, with small amounts of
calcium, sodium, lithium, fluorine, titanium, &amp;c., and ranges
in composition between (H, K)<span class="su">2</span>(Mg, Fe)<span class="su">4</span>(Al, Fe)<span class="su">2</span>(SiO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">4</span> and
(H, K)<span class="su">2</span>(Mg, Fe)<span class="su">2</span>Al<span class="su">2</span>(SiO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">3</span>.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.</td>
<td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.</td></tr></table>

<p>Like the other micas, it is monoclinic with pseudo-hexagonal
symmetry (figs. 1, 2) and possesses a perfect cleavage in one
direction (<i>c</i>). Biotite is, however, readily distinguished by its
darker colour, strong pleochroism, and small optic axial angle.
The colour is usually dark-green or brown; thick crystals are
often deep-black and opaque. The absorption of light-rays
vibrating parallel to the cleavage is much greater than of rays
vibrating in a direction perpendicular thereto, and in
dark-coloured crystals the former are almost completely absorbed.
The angle between the optic axes is usually very small, the
crystals being often practically uniaxial; an axial angle of 50°
has, however, been recorded in a dark-coloured biotite. The
specific gravity of biotite is, as a rule, higher than that of other
micas, varying from 2.7 to 3.1 according to the amount of iron
present. The hardness is 2½ to 3.</p>

<p>Several varieties of biotite are distinguished. By G. Tschermak
it is divided into two classes, <i>meroxene</i> and <i>anomite</i>;
in the former the plane of the optic axis coincides with the plane
of symmetry, whilst in the latter it is perpendicular thereto.
Meroxene includes nearly all ordinary biotite, and is the name
given by A. Breithaupt in 1841 to the Vesuvian crystals; on the
other hand, anomite (named from <span class="grk" title="anomos">&#7940;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;contrary to law&rdquo;)
is of rare occurrence. Haughtonite and siderophyllite are black
varieties rich in ferrous iron, and lepidomelane (from <span class="grk" title="lepis">&#955;&#949;&#960;&#943;&#962;</span>,
a scale, and <span class="grk" title="melas">&#956;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#962;</span>, black) is a variety rich in ferric iron.
In barytobiotite and manganophyllite the magnesia is partly
replaced by baryta and manganous oxide respectively. Rubellane,
hydrobiotite, pseudobiotite, and others are altered forms of
biotite, which is a mineral particularly liable to decomposition
with the production of chlorites and vermiculites.</p>

<p>Biotite is a common constituent of igneous and crystalline rocks;
in granite, gneiss and mica-schist it is often associated
with muscovite (white mica), the two kinds having sometimes
grown in parallel position. In volcanic rocks, and in nearly all
other kinds of igneous rocks with the exception of granite, biotite
occurs to the exclusion of the muscovite. In the dyke-rocks
known as mica-traps or mica-lamprophyres biotite is especially
abundant. It is also one of the most characteristic products
of contact-metamorphism, being developed in sedimentary
and other rocks at their contact with granite masses. In the
ejected blocks of crystalline limestone of Monte Somma,
Vesuvius, the most perfectly developed crystals of biotite
(figs. 1, 2), or indeed of any of the micas, are found in abundance,
associated with brilliant crystals of augite, olivine, humite, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Although biotite (black mica) is much more common and widely
distributed than white mica, yet it is of far less economic
importance. The small size of the sheets, their dark colour and
want of transparency render the material of little value. Large,
cleavable masses yielding fine smoky-black and green sheets,
sufficiently elastic for industrial purposes, are, however, found
in Renfrew county, Ontario.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRBHUM,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> a district of British India in the Burdwan division
of Bengal, situated in the Gangetic plain and partly on the hills,
being bounded on the south by the river Ajai. The administrative
headquarters are at Suri, which is the only town in the
district. The area comprises 1752 sq. m. The eastern portion of
the district is the ordinary alluvial plain of the Gangetic delta;
the western part consists of undulating beds of laterite resting on
a rock basis, and covered with small scrub jungle. The Ajai,
Bakheswar and Mor or Maurakshi, are the principal rivers of the
district, but they are merely hill streams and only navigable in
the rains. In 1901 the population was 902,280, showing an
increase of 13% in the decade. The principal industry is the
spinning and weaving of silk, chiefly from tussur or jungle
silkworms. There are also several lac factories. The loop-line of the
East Indian railway runs through the district, with a junction at
Nalhati for Murshidabad.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Birbhum in the early part of the 13th century was
a Hindu state, with its capital at Rajnagar or Nagar. In the
course of the century it was conquered by the Pathans and formed
part of the Pathan kingdom of Bengal. At the beginning of the
18th century it appears as a kind of military fief held under the
nawab of Murshidabad by one Asadullah Pathan, whose family
had probably been its chieftains since the fall of the Pathan
dynasty of Bengal in 1600. It passed into British possession in
1765, but the East India Company did not assume its direct
government until 1787, when that course became necessary. In the
interval it had been a prey to armed bands from the highlands of
Chota Nagpur, with whom the raja was unable to cope, and who
practically brought the trade of the Company in the district to
a standstill. The two border principalities of Birbhum and
Bankura were accordingly united into a district under a British
collector, being, however, separated again in 1793. By 1789, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page958" id="page958"></a>958</span>
considerable trouble, the marauders were driven back into their
mountains, and since that time (except during the Santal rising
of 1855) the district has been one of the most peaceful and
prosperous in India.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRCH, SAMUEL<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1813-1885), English Egyptologist and
antiquary, was born on the 3rd of November 1813, being the
son of the rector of St Mary Woolnoth, London. From an early
age he manifested a tendency to the study of out-of-the-way
subjects, and after a brief employment in the Record Office
obtained in 1836 an appointment in the antiquities department of
the British Museum on account of his knowledge of Chinese.
He soon extended his researches to Egyptian, and when the
cumbrous department came to be divided he was appointed to
the charge of the Egyptian and Assyrian branch. In the latter
language he had assistance, but for many years there was only
one other person in the institution&mdash;in a different department&mdash;who
knew anything of ancient Egyptian, and the entire arrangement
of the department devolved upon Birch. He found time
nevertheless for Egyptological work of the highest value, including
a hieroglyphical grammar and dictionary, translations of
<i>The Book of the Dead</i> and the Harris papyrus, and numerous
catalogues and guides. He further wrote what was long a
standard history of pottery, investigated the Cypriote syllabary,
and proved by various publications that he had not lost his old
interest in Chinese. Paradoxical in many of his views on things
in general, he was sound and cautious as a philologist; while
learned and laborious, he possessed much of the instinctive
divination of genius. He died on the 27th of December 1885.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRCH, THOMAS<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (1705-1766), English historian, son of
Joseph Birch, a coffee-mill maker, was born at Clerkenwell on the
23rd of November 1705. He preferred study to business, but as
his parents were Quakers he did not go to the university. Notwithstanding
this circumstance, he was ordained deacon in the
Church of England in 1730 and priest in 1731. As a strong
supporter of the Whigs, he gained the favour of Philip Yorke,
afterwards lord chancellor and first earl of Hardwicke, and his
subsequent preferments were largely due to this friendship.
He held successively a number of benefices in different counties,
and finally in London. In 1735 he became a member of the
Society of Antiquaries, and was elected a fellow of the Royal
Society, of which he was secretary from 1752 to 1765. In 1728 he
had married Hannah Cox, who died in the following year. Birch
was killed on the 9th of January 1766 by a fall from his horse,
and was buried in the church of St Margaret Pattens, London, of
which he was then rector. He left his books and manuscripts to
the British Museum, and a sum of about £500 to increase the
salaries of the three assistant librarians.</p>

<p>Birch had an enormous capacity for work and was engaged in a
large number of literary undertakings. In spite of their dulness
many of his works are of considerable value, although Horace
Walpole questioned his &ldquo;parts, taste and judgment.&rdquo; He
carried on an extensive correspondence with some of the leading
men of his time, and many of his letters appear in <i>Literary
Anecdotes of the 18th Century</i> (London, 1812-1815) and <i>Illustrations
of the Literary History of the 18th Century</i> (London, 1817-1858)
by J. Nichols, in the <i>Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</i>, vol. iii.
(London, 1780-1790), and in Boswell&rsquo;s <i>Life of Johnson</i>. Birch
wrote most of the English lives in the <i>General Dictionary,
Historical and Critical</i>, 10 vols. (London, 1734-1741), assisted
in the composition of the <i>Athenian Letters</i> (London, 1810), edited the
<i>State Papers</i> of John Thurloe (London, 1742) and the <i>State
Papers</i> of W. Murdin (London, 1759). He also wrote a <i>Life of
the Right Honourable Robert Boyle</i> (London, 1744); <i>Inquiry into
the share which King Charles I. had in the transactions of the Earl of
Glamorgan for bringing over a body of Irish rebels</i> (London, 1756);
<i>Historical view of Negotiations between the Courts of England,
France and Brussels 1592-1617</i> (London, 1749); <i>Life of Archbishop
Tillotson</i> (London, 1753); <i>Memoirs of the Reign of Queen
Elizabeth from 1581</i> (London, 1754); <i>History of the Royal
Society of London</i> (London, 1756-1757); <i>Life of Henry, Prince of
Wales</i> (London, 1760), and many other works. Among the
papers left at his death were some which were published in 1848
as the <i>Court and Times of James I</i>. and the <i>Court and Times of
Charles I</i>.</p>

and like it a member of the natural order <i>Betulaceae</i>. The various
species of birch are mostly trees of medium size, but several of
them are merely shrubs. They are as a rule of a very hardy
character, thriving best in northern latitudes&mdash;the trees having
round, slender branches, and serrate, deciduous leaves, with
barren and fertile catkins on the same tree, and winged fruits,
the so-called seeds. The bark in most of the trees occurs in fine
soft membranous layers, the outer cuticle of which peels off in
thin, white, papery sheets.</p>

<p>The common white or silver birch (<i>B. alba</i>) (see fig.) grows
throughout the greater part of Europe, and also in Asia Minor,
Siberia and North America, reaching in the north to the extreme
limits of forest vegetation,
and stretching
southward on
the European continent
as a forest tree
to 45° N. lat., beyond
which birches
occur only in special
situations or as isolated
trees. It is
well known in
England for its
graceful habit, the
slender, grey&mdash;or
white&mdash;barked stem,
the delicate, drooping
branches and the
quivering leaves, a
bright, clear green in
spring, becoming
duller in the summer,
but often keeping
their greenness
rather late into the
autumn. The male
and female flowers
are borne on separate
catkins in April and
May. It is a shortlived
tree, generally
from 40 to 50 ft.
high with a trunk seldom more than 1 ft. in diameter. It
flourishes in light soils and is one of the few trees that will grow
amongst heather; owing to the large number of  &ldquo;winged
seeds&rdquo; which are readily scattered by the wind, it spreads
rapidly, springing up where the soil is dry and covering clearings
or waste places.</p>

<p>The birch is one of the most wide-spread and generally useful
of forest trees of Russia, occurring in that empire in vast forests,
in many instances alone, and in other cases mingled with pines,
poplars and other forest trees. The wood is highly valued by
carriage-builders, upholsterers and turners, on account of its
toughness and tenacity, and in Russia it is prized as firewood
and a source of charcoal. A very extensive domestic industry
in Russia consists in the manufacture of wooden spoons, which
are made to the extent of 30,000,000 annually, mostly of birch.
Its pliant and flexible branches are made into brooms; and in
ancient Rome the fasces of the lictors, with which they cleared
the way for the magistrates, were made up of birch rods. A
similar use of birch rods has continued among pedagogues to
times so recent that the birch is yet, literally or metaphorically,
the instrument of school-room discipline. The bark of the
common birch is much more durable, and industrially of greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page959" id="page959"></a>959</span>
value, than the wood. It is impermeable to water, and is therefore
used in northern countries for roofing, for domestic utensils,
for boxes and jars to contain both solid and liquid substances,
and for a kind of bark shoes, of which it is estimated 25 millions
of pairs are annually worn by the Russian peasantry. The
jars and boxes of birch bark made by Russian peasants are
often stamped with very effective patterns. By dry distillation
the bark yields an empyreumatic oil, called <i>diogott</i> in Russia,
used in the preparation of Russia leather; to this oil the peculiar
pleasant odour of the leather is due. The bark itself is used in
tanning; and by the Samoiedes and Kamchatkans it is ground
up and eaten on account of the starchy matter it contains. A
sugary sap is drawn from the trunk in the spring before the
opening of the leaf-buds, and is fermented into a kind of beer and
vinegar. The whole tree, but especially the bark and leaves,
has a very pleasant resinous odour, and from the young leaves
and buds an essential oil is distilled with water. The leaves are
used as fodder in northern latitudes.</p>

<p>The species which belong peculiarly to America (<i>B. lenta,
excelsa, nigra, papyracea</i>, &amp;c.) are generally similar in appearance
and properties to <i>B. alba</i>, and have the same range of applications.
The largest and most valuable is the black birch (<i>B.
lenta</i>) found abundantly over an extensive area in British North
America, growing 60 to 70 ft. high and 2 to 3 ft. in diameter.
It is a wood most extensively used for furniture and for carriage-building,
being tough in texture and bearing shocks well, while
much of it has a handsome grain and it is susceptible of a fine
polish. The bark, which is dark brown or reddish, and very
durable, is used by Indians and backwoodsmen in the same way
as the bark of <i>B. alba</i> is used in northern Europe.</p>

<p>The canoe or paper birch (<i>B. papyracea</i>) is found as far north
as 70° N. on the American continent, but it becomes rare and
stunted in the Arctic circle. Professor Charles Sprague Sargent
says: &ldquo;It is one of the most widely distributed trees of North
America. From Labrador it ranges to the southern shores of
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay and to those of the Great Bear Lake, and to the
valley of the Yukon and the coast of Alaska, forming with the
aspen, the larch, the balsam poplar, the banksian pine, the
black and white spruces and the balsam fir, the great subarctic
transcontinental forest; and southward it ranges through all
the forest region of the Dominion of Canada and the northern
states.&rdquo; It is a tree of the greatest value to the inhabitants of
the Mackenzie river district in British North America. Its bark
is used for the construction of canoes, and for drinking-cups,
dishes and baskets. From the wood, platters, axe-handles,
snow-shoe frames, and dog sledges are made, and it is worked
into articles of furniture which are susceptible of a good polish.
The sap which flows in the spring is drawn off and boiled down
to an agreeable spirit, or fermented with a birch-wine of considerable
alcoholic strength. The bark is also used as a substitute
for paper. A species (<i>B. Bhojputtra</i>) growing on the Himalayan
Mountains, as high up as 9000 ft., yields large quantities of fine
thin papery bark, extensively sent down to the plains as a substitute
for wrapping paper, for covering the &ldquo;snakes&rdquo; of
hookahs and for umbrellas. It is also said to be used as writing
paper by the mountaineers; and in Kashmir it is in general use
for roofing houses.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRCH-PFEIFFER, CHARLOTTE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1800-1868), German
actress and dramatic writer, was born at Stuttgart on the 23rd
of June 1800, the daughter of an estate agent named Pfeiffer.
She received her early training at the Munich court theatre, and
in 1818 began to play leading tragic rôles at various theatres.
In 1825 she married the historian Christian Birch of Copenhagen,
but continued to act. From 1837 to 1843 she managed the
theatre at Zürich. In 1844 she accepted an engagement at the
royal theatre in Berlin, to which she remained attached until
her death on the 24th of August 1868. Her intimate knowledge
of the technical necessities of the stage fitted her for the successful
dramatization of many popular novels, and her plays, adapted
and original, make twenty-three volumes, <i>Gesammelte dramatische
Werke</i> (Leip. 1863-1880). Many still retain the public
favour. Her novels and tales, <i>Gesammelte Novellen und
Erzählungen</i>, were collected in three volumes (Leip. 1863-1865).</p>

<p>Her daughter, <span class="sc">Wilhelmine von Hillern</span> (b. 1836), born
at Munich, went on the stage, but retired upon her marriage
in 1857. After 1889 she lived in Oberammergau and won a
reputation as a novelist. Her most popular works are <i>Ein Arzt
der Seele</i> (1869, 4th ed. 1886); and <i>Die Geier-Wally</i> (1883),
which was dramatized and translated into English as <i>The
Vulture Maiden</i> (Leip. 1876).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIRD,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> the common English name for feathered vertebrates,
members of the class <i>Aves</i>. The word in Old Eng. is <i>brid</i> and
in Mid. Eng. <i>byrd</i> or <i>bryd</i>, and in early uses meant the young
or nestlings only. It is partly due to this early meaning that the
derivation from the root of &ldquo;brood&rdquo; has been usually accepted;
this the <i>New English Dictionary</i> regards as &ldquo;inadmissible.&rdquo;
The word does not occur in any other Teutonic language. As
a generic name for the feathered vertebrates &ldquo;bird&rdquo; has replaced
the older &ldquo;fowl,&rdquo; a common Teutonic word, appearing in
German as <i>Vogel</i>. &ldquo;Bird,&rdquo; when it passed from its earliest
meaning of &ldquo;nestlings,&rdquo; seems to have been applied to the smaller,
and &ldquo;fowl&rdquo; to the larger species, a distinction which was
retained by Johnson. In modern usage &ldquo;fowl,&rdquo; except in
&ldquo;wild-fowl&rdquo; or &ldquo;water-fowl,&rdquo; is confined to domestic poultry.</p>

<p>The scope of the anatomical part of the following article is
a general account of the structure of birds (<i>Aves</i>) in so far as
they, as a class, differ from other vertebrates, notably reptiles
and mammals, whilst features especially characteristic, peculiar
or unique, have been dwelt upon at greater length so far as space
permitted. References to original papers indicate further

<p class="pt2 center sc">A. Anatomy of Birds</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Skeleton</i>.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;When W.K. Parker wrote the account of the skull
in the article <span class="sc">Birds</span> for the 9th edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</i>, he had still to wrestle with the general problem of
the composition and evolution of the skull. That chapter of
comparative anatomy (together with other anatomical details,
for which see the separate articles) is now dealt with in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Skull</a></span>; here only the most avine features are alluded to,
and since some of Parker&rsquo;s original illustrations have been
retained, the description has been shortened considerably.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>One general feature of the adult bird&rsquo;s skull is the almost complete
disappearance of the sutures between the bones of the cranium
proper, whilst another is the great movability of the whole palatal
and other suspensorial apparatus. The occipital condyle (fig. 1)
is a single knob, being formed almost wholly by the basioccipital,
while the lateral occipitals (often perversely called exoccipitals) take
but little share in it. Part of the membranous roof between the
supra-occipital and parietal bones frequently remains unossified
and presents in the macerated skull a pair of fontanelles. The squamosals
form the posterior outer margin of the orbits and are
frequently continued into two lateral downward processes across the
temporal fossa. One of these, the <i>processus orbitatis posterior</i>, often
combines with an outgrowth of the alisphenoid, and may be, <i>e.g.</i> in
cockatoos, continued forwards to the lacrymal bone, so as to form
a complete infraorbital bridge. The posterior, so-called <i>processus
Zygomaticus</i> is very variable; in many Galli it encloses a foramen
by distally joining the orbital process. The ethmoid frequently
appears on the dorsal surface between the frontals. There are three
periotic bones (pro-, epi-, opisth-otic). The proötic encloses between
it and the lateral occipital the fenestra ovalis, into which fits the
columella of the ear. The epiotic is often small, ossifies irregularly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page960" id="page960"></a>960</span>
and fuses with the supra-occipital. The opisthotic lies between the
epiotic and the lateral occipital with which it ultimately fuses; in
some birds, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Larus</i>, it extends far enough to help to bound the
foramen magnum. The basisphenoids are ventrally overlaid, and
later on fused with, a pair of membrane bones, the basi-temporals,
homologous in part with the parasphenoid of lower vertebrates.
They contribute to the formation of the auditory meatus, and of the
right and left carotid canals which accompany the eustachian tubes.
In many birds the basisphenoids send out a pair of basipterygoid
processes by which they articulate with the pterygoids. Dorso-laterally
the basisphenoid is joined by the alisphenoid, which forms
most of the posterior wall of the orbit. The orbito-sphenoids diverge
only posteriorly, otherwise they are practically unpaired and form
the median interorbital septum, which is very large in correlation
with the extraordinary size of the eyeballs.,</p>

<p class="pt2">Prefrontal bones are absent; post-frontals are possibly indicated
by a frequently occurring separate centre of ossification in the
post-orbital process, to which the frontals always contribute. The
lacrymal is always present, and perforated by a glandular duct.
Attached to it or the neighbouring frontal is often a supraorbital;
infraorbitals occur also, attached to the jugal or downward process
of the lacrymal. The nasals were used by A.H. Garrod to distinguish
the birds as holorhinal (fig. 2) where the anterior margin of the nasal
is concave, and schizorhinal where this posterior border of the outer
nares is continued
backwards into a
slit which extends
beyond the frontal
processes of the premaxilla.
Many birds
possess a more or
less well developed
cross-joint in front
of the frontals and
lacrymals, perhaps
best developed in
<i>Anseres</i> and <i>Psittaci</i>.
Owing to this joint
the whole upper beak
can be moved up
and down with extra
facility, according to
the shoving forwards
or backwards of the
palato-pterygo-quadrate
apparatus which
moves sledge-like
upon the cranial
basis. The premaxilla
is always unpaired,
but each half has
three long processes
directed backwards;
one fuses with the
maxillary bone, another
helps to form
the anterior part of
the palate, while the
third, together with
its fellow, forms the
&ldquo;culmen&rdquo; and extends
backwards to
the frontals, or rather
to the ethmoid which
there crops up on the
surface. The maxillaries
(fig. 3) have
besides others, a
maxillo-palatine process
directed inwards
in a transverse horizontal
direction. The
palatines are long,
always fused anteriorly
with the
premaxilla, and frequently
with the maxillo-palatine processes; posteriorly they slide
upon the presphenoidal rostrum, and articulate in most birds with
the pterygoids; they form the greater part of the palatal roof and
border the choanae or inner nares. Between these, resting vertically
upon the rostrum, appears the vomer; very variable in shape and
size, often reduced to a mere trace, as in the Galli, or even absent,
broken up into a pair of tiny splints in Pici.</p>

<p>The taxonomic importance of the configurations of the palate was
first pointed out by J. de Cornay. T.H. Huxley, in 1868, divided
the carinate birds into Dromaeo-, Schizo-, Desmo-, and Aegithognathae,
an arrangement which for many years had a considerable
influence upon classification. However, subsequent additions and
corrections have detracted much from its value, especially when it
became understood that the above sub-orders are by no means
natural groups. <i>Dromaeognathae</i> have a struthious palate, with
a broad vomer meeting in front the broad maxillo-palatal plates,
while behind it reaches the pterygoids. The only representatives
are the Tinamous. <i>Schizognathae</i>, <i>e.g.</i> fowls (fig. 4), pigeons, gulls,
plovers, rails and penguins, have the vomer pointed in front while
the maxillo-palatines are free, leaving a fissure between the vomer
and themselves. The schizognathous formation is doubtless the
most primitive, and its representatives form a tolerably natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page961" id="page961"></a>961</span>
assembly. <i>Desmognathae</i> (fig. 5) were supposed to have the maxillo-palatines
united across the middle line, either directly or by the intermediation
of ossifications in the nasal septum. This is a hopeless assembly.
Parker and Fürbringer have demonstrated that desmognathism has been
produced in half a dozen ways, implying numerous cases of convergence
without any nearer relationship than
that they are all derived from some schizognathous group or other.
The <i>Aegithognathae</i>, meant to comprise the passeres, woodpeckers and
swifts, &amp;c., are really schizognathous but with a vomer which is
broadly truncated in front.</p>

<p class="pt2">The remainder of the appendicular skeleton (fig. 6) of the head
requires little description. The maxillaries are connected with the
distal anterior corner of the quadrate by the thin, splint-like jugal
and quadratojugal. The quadrate is invariably a conspicuous
bone and movably articulating with the cranium and by a special
process with the pterygoid. The mandible is composed of several
bones as in reptiles. The os articulare bears on its inner side the inner
mandibular process which serves for the insertion of part of the
digastric muscle or opener of the mouth; another portion of this
muscle is attached to the os angulare, which frequently forms a
posterior mandibular process. The greater part of the under-jaw
is formed by the right and left dentaries, which in all recent birds are
fused together in front. Supra-angular and coronoid splint-bones
serve for the insertion of part of the temporal or masseter muscle.
Additional splints rest on the inner side of the jaw. Like the crocodiles,
birds possess a <i>siphonium</i>, <i>i.e</i>. a membranous, or ossified, tube
which rises from a pneumatic foramen in the os articulare, on the
median side of the articulation, and passes upwards between the
quadrate and lateral occipital bone, opening into the cavity of the
middle ear.</p>

<p class="pt2">The <i>Hyoid apparatus</i> is, in its detail, subject to many variations
in accord with the very diverse uses to which the tongue of birds is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page962" id="page962"></a>962</span>
put. It consists of (1) the basihyal variously called copula, or
corpus linguae, or unpaired middle portion. (2) The urohyal likewise
unpaired, rested ventrally on the larynx. (3) The os entoglossum
originally paired, but coalescing into an arrow-headed piece,
attached to the anterior end of the basihyal and lodged in the
tongue proper. It is homologous with the
distal ends of the ceratohyals or ventral
elements of the hyoidean or second visceral
arch. The dorsal or hyomandibular portion
of this same arch is transformed into the
auditory chain, ending in the fenestra ovalis.
(4) A pair of thyrohyals, homologous with
the posterior hyoid horns of mammals, <i>i.e.</i>
third visceral or first branchial arch. As the
most developed pair in birds they are commonly,
although wrongly, called the hyoid
horns. They articulate upon facets of the
hinder outer corners of the basihyal.</p>

<p>The vertebrae are stereospondylous, the
centrum or body and the arch being completely
fused into one mass, leaving not even
a neuro-central suture. The arch alone sends
out processes, viz. the spinous process, the
anterior and posterior oblique (commonly
called pre- and post-zygapophyses), and the
transverse processes. The latter articulate
with the tuberculum of the corresponding
rib, while the capitulum articulates by a
knob on the side of the anterior end of the
centrum. In the cervical region the ribs
are much reduced, fused with their vertebrae
and enclosing the transverse canal or
foramen. When the vertebrae are free their
centra articulate with each other by complicated
joints, exhibiting four types.
(1) Amphicoelous; each end of the centrum is
concave; this, the lowest condition, is
embryonic, but was retained in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and in the thoracic vertebrae of <i>Ichthyornis</i>.
(2) Procoelous, concave in front; only in the
atlas, for the reception of the occipital condyle.
(3) Opisthocoelous, or concave behind,
only occasionally found in the
thoracic region, <i>e.g.</i> Sphenisci.
(4) Heterocoelous (fig. 8) or saddle-shaped; the
anterior surface is concave in a transverse,
but convex in a vertical direction, which on
posterior surface shows the conditions reversed.
This is the most perfect arrangement
attained by the vertebral column, and is
typical of, and restricted to, birds. The
intervertebral joints are further complicated by
the interposition of a cartilaginous or fibrous
pad or ring. This pad varies much; it is
morphologically the homologue of the pair
of basiventral elements which by their
lateral extension give origin to the
corresponding ribs. Later those pads fuse with
the anterior end of the centrum of the
vertebra to which they belong; where the
vertebral column is rendered inflexible, the
disks are ossified with the centra and all
trace of them is lost. Sometimes the pad is
reduced to a ventral semi-ring or meniscus;
it retains its largest almost original shape
and size in the second vertebra, the axis or epistropheus, where
it forms a separately ossifying piece which connects, and coössifies
with, the odontoid process (the centrum of the atlas) and the centrum
of the second vertebra. Sometimes the ventral portions of these pads
form paired or unpaired little ossifications, then generally described as
intercentra; such are not uncommon on the tail. The atlas is composed of
three pieces; a pair of lateral elements (the right and left dorsal arch
pieces) joining above the spinal cord, and a ventral piece equivalent to
the first basiventral elements, <i>i.e.</i>  serially homologous with the
intervertebral pads. In the adults the atlas forms a more or less solid
ring. A remnant of the <i>chorda dorsalis</i> and its sheath persists as
the <i>ligamentum suspensorium</i> between the central portions of the
successive vertebrae.</p>

<p>In birds we distinguish between the following regions of the <i>axial skeleton</i>.
(1) Cervical vertebrae, or those between the skull and the
first vertebra which is connected with the sternum by a pair of
complete ribs. The last 1 to 5 of these vertebrae have movable ribs
which do not reach the sternum, and are called cervico-dorsals.
(2) Dorsals, those which begin with the first thoracic rib, and end at
the last that is not fused with the ilium. The term &ldquo;lumbar&rdquo; vertebrae
is inapplicable to birds. (3) Pelvic, all those which are fused
with the iliac portion of the pelvis, generally a considerable number.
(4) Caudal, those which are not connected with the pelvis. It is
to be noted that often no absolute line of demarcation can be drawn in
regard to these regions, their definitions being rather convenient
than morphological.</p>

<p>In comparison with all other vertebrates
the number of neck-vertebrae of
the birds is considerably increased; the
lowest number, 14 to 15, is that of
most Passeres and many other Coraciomorphae;
the largest numbers, 20 or 21,
are found in the ostrich, 23 in
<i>Cygnus olor</i> and 25 in the black swan.
Dorsal vertebrae frequently have a ventral
outgrowth of the centrum; these hypapophyses
may be simple vertical blades,
&#8869;-shaped, or paired knobs; they serve
for the attachment of the thoracic
origin of the longus collianticus muscle,
reaching their greatest development in
Sphenisci and Colymbidae. In many
birds some of the thoracic vertebrae are
more or less coössified, in most pigeons
for instance the 15th to 17th; in most
Galli the last cervical and the next three
or four thoracics are coalesced, &amp;c.
The pelvic vertebrae include of course
the sacrum. There are only two or
three vertebrae which are equivalent to
those of the reptiles; these true sacrals
are situated in a level just behind the
acetabulum; as a rule between these
two primary sacral vertebrae issues the
last of the spinal nerves which
contributes to the composition of the
sciadic plexus. These true sacrals alone
are connected with the ilium by processes
which are really equivalent to
modified ribs; but the pelvis of birds
extends considerably farther forwards
and backwards, gradually coming into
contact with other vertebrae, which in various ways send out
connecting transverse processes or buttresses, and thus become
pre- and post-sacral vertebrae (fig. 9). The most anterior
part of the ilium often overlaps one or more short lumbar
ribs and fuses with them, or even a long, complete thoracic rib.
Similarly during the growth of the bird the posterior end of the ilium
connects itself with the transverse processes of vertebrae which were
originally free, thus transforming them from caudals into secondary
post-sacrals. Individual, specific and generic variations are frequent.</p>

<p>The last six or seven caudal vertebrae
coalesce into the pygostyle, an upright
blade which carries the rectrices. Such
a pygostyle is absent in <i>Archaeopteryx,
Hesperornis, Tinami</i> and <i>Ratitae</i>, but
it occurs individually in old specimens of
the ostrich and the kiwi. In <i>Ichthyornis</i>
it is very small. In all the <i>Neornithes</i>
the total number of caudal vertebrae,
inclusive of those which coalesce, is
reduced to at least 13.</p>

<p><i>Sternum</i> (figs. 10 and 11).&mdash;Characteristic
features of the sternum are the following.
There is a well-marked <i>processus
lateralis anterior</i> (the right and
left together equivalent to the mammalian
manubrium), which is the
product of two or three ribs, the
dorsal parts of which reduced ribs
remain as cervico-dorsal ribs. Then
follows the rib-bearing portion and
then the <i>processus lateralis posterior</i>;
this also is the product of ribs, consequently
the right and left processes
together are equivalent to the xiphoid process or xiphisternum
of the mammals. The lateral process in most birds sends out an
outgrowth, directed out and upwards, overlapping some of the ribs,
the <i>processus obliquus</i>. The median and posterior extension of
the body of the sternum is a direct outgrowth of the latter, therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page963" id="page963"></a>963</span>
called meta-sternum. The anterior margin of the sternum, between
the right and left anterior lateral processes receives in sockets the
feet of the coracoids. Between them arises a median crest, which
varies much in extent and composition, and is of considerable taxonomic
value. It is represented either by a <i>spina interna</i> or by a
<i>spina externa</i>, or
by both, or they
join to form a
<i>spina communis</i>
which is often very
large and sometimes
ends in a
bifurcation. Eventually,
when the
right and left feet
of the coracoids
overlap each other,
the anterior sternal
spine contains a
foramen. The keel,
or <i>carina sterni</i>, is
formed as a direct
cartilaginous outgrowth
of the body
of the sternum,
ossifying from a
special centre.
This keel is much
reduced in the
New Zealand
parrot, <i>Stringops</i>,
less in various
flightless rails, in
the dodo and solitaire.
It is absent in the Ratitae, which from this feature have
received their name, but considerable traces of a cartilaginous
keel occur in the embryo of the ostrich, showing undeniably
that the absence of a keel in the recent bird is not a primitive,
fundamental feature. The keel has been lost, and is being lost,
at various epochs and by various groups of birds. The swimming
<i>Hesperornis</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Odontornithes</a></span>) was also devoid of such
a structure. In many birds the spaces between the meta-sternum
and the posterior processes and again the spaces between this and
the oblique process are filled up by proceeding ossification and either
remain as notches, or as fenestrae, or they are completely abolished
so that the breastbone is turned into one solid more or less oblong
plate.</p>

<p><i>Shoulder Girdle.</i>&mdash;Scapula, coracoid and clavicle, meet to form the
foramen triosseum, through which passes the tendon of the <i>supracoracoideus</i>,
or <i>subclavius</i> muscle to the <i>tuberculum superius</i> of the
humerus. The coracoid is one of the most characteristic bones of
the bird&rsquo;s skeleton. Its upper end forms the acrocoracoid process,
against the inner surface of which leans the proximal portion of the
clavicle. From the inner side of the neck of the coracoid arises the
precoracoidal process, the remnant of the precoracoid. Only in the
ostrich this element is almost typically complete, although soon
fused at either end with the coracoid. Near the base of the precoracoidal
process is a small foramen for the passage of the <i>nervus
supracoracoideus</i>. In most birds the feet of the coracoids do not
touch each other; in some groups they meet, in others one overlaps
the other, the right lying ventrally upon the left. The scapula is
sabre-shaped, and extends backwards over the ribs, lying almost
parallel to the vertebral column. This is a peculiar character of
all birds. The clavicles, when united, as usual, form the furcula;
mostly the distal median portion is drawn out into a hypocleidium
of various shape. Often it reaches the keel of the sternum, with
subsequent syndosmosis or even synostosis, <i>e.g.</i> in the gannet. In
birds of various groups the clavicles are more or less degenerated,
the reduction beginning at the distal end. This condition occurs
in the Ratitae as well as in the well-flying <i>Platyrcecinae</i> amongst
parrots.</p>

<p class="pt2">The <i>fore-limb</i> or <i>wing</i> (fig. 12); highly specialized for flight, which,
initiated and made possible mainly by the strong development
of quill-feathers, has turned the wing into a unique organ. The
humerus with its crests, ridges and processes, presents so many modifications
characteristic of the various groups of birds, that its configuration
alone is not only of considerable taxonomic value but that
almost any genus, excepting, of course, those of Passeres, can be
&ldquo;spotted&rdquo; by a close examination and comparison of this bone.
When the wing is folded the long glenoid surface of the head of the
humerus is bordered above by the <i>tuberculum externum</i> or <i>superius</i>,
in the middle and below by the <i>tuberculum medium</i> or <i>inferius</i> for
the insertion of the <i>coraco-brachialis posterior</i> muscle. From the outer
tuberculum extends the large <i>crista superior</i> (insertion of <i>pectoralis
major</i> and of <i>deltoideus major</i> muscles). The ventral portion of the
neck is formed by the strong <i>crista inferior</i>, on the median side of
which is the deep <i>fossa subtrochanterica</i> by which air sacs enter the
humerus. On the outer side of the humerus between the head and
the <i>crista inferior</i> is a groove lodging one of the coraco-humeral
ligaments. The distal end of the humerus ends in a trochlea, with
a larger knob for the ulna and a smaller oval knob for the radius.
Above this knob is often present an ectepicondylar process whence
arise the tendons of the ulnar and radial flexors. The radius is the
straighter and more slender of the two forearm bones. Its proximal
end forms a shallow cup for articulation with the outer condyle of
the humerus; the distal end bears a knob which fits into the radial
carpal. The ulna is curved and rather stout; it articulates with both
carpal bones; the cubital quills often cause rugosities on its dorsal
surface. Of wrist-bones only two remain in the adult bird; the
original distal carpals coalesce with the proximal end of the metacarpals.
These are reduced, in all birds, to three, but traces of the
fourth have been observed in embryos. The first metacarpal is
short and fuses throughout its length with the second. This and the
third are much longer and fuse together at their upper and distal
ends, leaving as a rule a space between the shafts. The pollex and
the third finger are as a rule reduced to one phalanx each, while the
index still has two. The first and second fingers frequently carry
a little claw. The greatest reduction of the hand-skeleton is met
with in <i>Dromaeus</i> and in <i>Apteryx</i>, which retain only the index finger.
It is of importance for our understanding of the position of the
Ratitae in the system, that the wing-skeleton of the ostrich and
rhea is an exact repetition of that of typical flying birds; the bones
are much more slender, and the muscles are considerably reduced
in strength also to a lesser extent in numbers, but the total length of
the wing of an ostrich or a rhea is actually and comparatively
enormous. Starting with the kiwi and cassowary, people have got
into the habit of confounding flightless with wingless conditions.
It is absolutely certain that the wings of the Ratitae bear the
strongest testimony that they are the descendants of typical flying
birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page964" id="page964"></a>964</span></p>

<p>The <i>pelvis</i> (fig. 13), consisting of the sacrum (already described)
and the pelvic arch, namely ilium, ischium and pubis, it follows that
only birds and mammals possess a pelvis proper, whilst such is
entirely absent in the Amphibia and in reptiles with the exception
of some of the Dinosaurs. The ventral inner margin of the preacetabular
portion of the ilium is attached to the pre-sacral vertebrae,
whilst the inner and dorsal margin of the postacetabular portion is
attached to the primary sacral and the postsacral vertebrae. In
rare cases the right and left preacetabular blades fuse with each other
above the spinous processes. In front of the acetabulum a thick
process of the ilium descends to meet the pubis, and a similar process
behind meets the ischium. The acetabulum is completely surrounded
by these three bones, but its cup always retains an open
foramen; from its posterior rim arises the strong antitrochanter.
The ischium and postacetabular ilium originally enclose the ischiadic
notch or <i>incisura ischiadica</i>. This primitive condition occurs only
in the Odontornithes (<i>q.v.</i>), Ratitae and Tinami; in all others this
notch becomes converted into a <i>foramen ischiadicum</i>, through which
pass the big stems of the ischiadic nerves and most of the blood-vessels
of the hind-limb. The pubis consists of a short anterior
portion (<i>spina pubica</i> or pectineal process, homologous with the
prepubic process of Dinosaurs) and the long and slender pubis
proper (equivalent to the <i>processus lateralis pubis</i> of most reptiles).
The shaft of the pubis runs parallel with that of the ischium, with
which it is connected by a short ligamentous or bony bridge; this
cuts off from the long <i>incisura pubo-ischiadica</i> a proximal portion,
the <i>foramen obturatum</i>, for the passage of the obturator nerve. Only
in the ostrich the distal ends of the pubes meet, forming a dagger-shaped
symphysis, which is curved forwards. The pectineal process
is variable; it may grow entirely from the pubis, or both pubis and
ilium partake of its formation, or lastly its pubic portion may be
lost and the process is entirely formed by the ilium. It is largest in
the Galli and some of the Cuculi, in others it is hardly indicated. It
served originally for the origin of the ambiens muscle (see <i>Muscular
System</i> below); shifting or disappearance of this muscle, of course,
influences the process.</p>

<p><i>The Hind Limb.</i>&mdash;The femur often possesses a well visible pneumatic
foramen on the median side of the proximal end of its shaft.
The inner condyle, the intercondylar sulcus, and a portion only
of its outer condyle, articulate with corresponding facets of the
tibia. The outer condyle articulates mainly with the fibula. There
is a patella, intercalated in the tendon of the <i>femori-tibialis</i> or <i>extensor
cruris</i> muscle. In <i>Colymbus</i> the patella is reduced to a small ossicle,
its function being taken by the greatly developed pyramidal <i>processus
tibialis anterior</i>; in <i>Podiceps</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i> the patella itself is
large and pyramidal. The distal half of the fibula is very slender
and normally does not reach the ankle-joint; it is attached to the
peroneal ridge of the tibia. On the anterior side of the tibia, is the
intercondylar sulcus, which is crossed by an oblique bridge of tendon
or bone, acting as a pulley for the tendon of the <i>extensor digitorum
communis</i> muscle. The condyles of the tibia are in reality not parts
of this bone, but are the three proximal tarsalia which fuse together
and with the distal end of the tibia. The distal tarsalia likewise fuse
together, and then on to the upper ends of the metatarsals; the
<i>tarsale centrale</i> remains sometimes as a separate osseous nodule,
buried in the inter-articular pad. Consequently the ankle-joint of
birds is absolutely cruro-tarsal and tarso-metatarsal, <i>i.e.</i> intertarsal,
an arrangement absolutely diagnostic of birds if it did not also occur
in some of the Dinosaurs. Of the metatarsals the fifth occurs as
an embryonic vestige near the joint; the first is reduced to its distal
portion, and is, with the hallux, shoved on to the inner and posterior
side of the foot, at least in the majority of birds. The three
middle metatarsals become fused together into a cannon bone; the
upper part of the third middle metatarsal projects behind and forms
the so-called hypotarsus, which in various ways, characteristic of
the different groups of birds (with one or more sulci, grooved or
perforated), acts as guiding pulley to the tendons of the flexor
muscles of the toes. Normally the four toes have two, three, four
and five phalanges respectively, but in <i>Cypselus</i> the number is
reduced to three in the front toes. Reduction of the number of toes
(the fifth shows no traces whatever, not even in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>)
begins with the hallux, which is completely or partly absent in many
birds; the second toe is absent in <i>Struthio</i> only. The short feet of the
penguins are quite plantigrade, in adaptation to which habit the
metatarsals lie in one plane and are incompletely co-ossified, thus
presenting a pseudo-primitive condition.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>2. Muscular System.</i></p>

<p>Of the muscles of the stem or axis, those of the neck and tail
are well-developed and specialized, while those of the lower
back are more or less reduced, or even completely degenerated
owing to the rigidity of this region, brought about by the great
antero-posterior extent of the pelvis.</p>

<p>The muscles of the limbs show a great amount of specialization,
away from the fundamental reptilian and mammalian
conditions. The muscles of the fore limbs are most aberrant,
but at the same time more uniformly developed than those of
the hinder extremities. The reasons are obvious. The whole
wing is a unique modification, deeply affecting the skeletal,
muscular and tegumentary structures, but fluttering, skimming,
sailing, soaring are motions much more akin to one another than
climbing and grasping, running, scratching, paddling and wading.
The modifications of the hind-limbs are in fact many times
greater (such as extremely long legs, with four, three or only two
toes; very short legs, almost incapable of walking, with all four
toes directed forwards, or two or one backwards, and two or
more connected and therefore bound to act together, in various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page965" id="page965"></a>965</span>
ways). Thus it has come to pass that the muscles of the hind
limbs are, like their framework, more easily compared with those
of reptiles and mammals than are the wings, whilst within the
class of birds they show an enormous amount of variation in
direct correlation with their manifold requirements. The only
really aberrant modifications of the wing-muscles are found in
the Ratitae, where they are, however, all easily explained by
reduction, and in the penguins, where the wings are greatly
specialized into blades for rowing with screw-like motions.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The wing of the bird is folded in a unique way, namely, the radius
parallel with the humerus, and the whole wrist and hand with their
ulnar side against the ulna; upper and forearm in a state of supination,
the hand in that of strong abduction. Dorsal and ventral
bending, even in the extended wing, is almost impossible. Consequently
only a few of the original extensor muscles have been preserved,
but these are much modified into very independent organs,
notably the <i>extensor metacarpi radialis longus</i>, the <i>ext. metac. ulnaris</i>
and the two <i>radio</i>- and <i>ulnari-metacarpi</i> muscles, all of which are
inserted upon the metacarpus by means of long tendons. The chief
muscular mass, arising from the sternum in the shape of a U, is the
<i>pectoralis</i> muscle; its fibres converge into a strong tendon, which is
inserted upon the greater tubercle and upper crest of the humerus,
which it depresses and slightly rotates forwards during the downstroke.
This great muscle covers completely the <i>supracoracoideus</i>,
generally described as the second pectoral, or <i>subclavius</i> muscle, in
reality homologous with the mammalian <i>supraspinatus</i> muscle. This
arises mostly from the angle formed by the keel with the body of
the sternum, passes by a strong tendon through the <i>foramen triosseum</i>,
and is inserted upon the upper tubercle of the humeral crest,
which it rotates and abducts. The extent of the origin of this
muscle from the sternum, on which it leaves converging, parallel or
diverging impressions, is of some taxonomic value.</p>

<p>Much labour has been bestowed by A.H. Garrod and Max Fürbringer
upon the investigation of the variations of the inserting
tendons of the patagial muscles (fig. 14), mainly from a taxonomic
point of view. The <i>propatagialis longus</i> muscle is composed of
slips from the deltoid, pectoral, biceps and <i>cucullaris</i> muscles. Its
strong belly originates near the shoulder joint from clavicle, coracoid
and scapula. Its elastic tendon runs directly to the carpus,
forming thereby the outer margin of the anterior patagium, or fold
of skin between the upper and forearm, which it serves to extend,
together with the <i>propatagialis brevis</i> muscle. This runs down
the anterior and outer side of the upper arm, and is attached to the
proximal tendon of the <i>extensor metacarpi radialis longus</i>, a little
below the outer condyle of the humerus. In most birds the tendon
is split into several portions, one of which is often attached to the
outer side of the ulna, below the elbow joint, while others are in
variable but characteristic ways connected with similar slips of the
<i>propatagialis longus</i>. The posterior patagium, the fold between
trunk and inner surface of the upper arm, is stretched by the <i>metapatagialis</i>
muscle, which is composed of slips from the <i>serratus, superficialis,
latissimus dorsi</i> and the <i>expansor secundariorum muscles</i>.
This, the stretcher of the cubital quills, is a very interesting muscle.
Arising as a long tendon from the sterno-scapular ligament, it passes
the axilla by means of a fibrous pulley, accompanies the axillary
vessels and nerves along the humerus, and is inserted by a few fleshy
fibres on the base of the last two or three cubital quills. Here, alone,
at the distal portion of the tendon, occur muscular fibres, but these
are unstriped, belonging to the category of cutaneous muscles. We
have here the interesting fact that a muscle (portion of the <i>triceps
humeri</i> of the reptiles) has been reduced to a tendon, which in a secondary
way has become connected with cutaneous muscles, which,
when strongly developed, represent its belly.</p>

<p>The <i>flexor digitorum sublimis</i> muscle arises fleshy from the long
elastic band which extends from the inner humeral condyle along
the ventral surface of the ulna to the ulnar carpal bone, over which
the tendon runs to insert itself on the radial anterior side of the first
phalanx of the second digit. Owing to the elasticity of the humerocarpal
band the wing remains closed without any special muscular
exertion, while, when the wing is extended, this band assists in keeping
it taut. The arm-muscles have been studied in an absolutely
exhaustive manner by Fürbringer, who in his monumental work
has tabulated and then scrutinized the chief characters of fourteen
selected muscles. The results are as interesting from a morphological
point of view (showing the subtle and gradual modifications of
these organs in their various adaptations), as they are sparse in
taxonomic value, far less satisfactory than are those of the hind-limb.
He was, however, the first to show clearly that the Ratitae are the
retrograde descendants of flying ancestors, that the various groups
of surviving Ratitae are, as such, a polyphyletic group, and he has
gone fully into the interesting question of the development and
subsequent loss of the power of flight, a loss which has taken place
not only in different orders of birds but also at various geological
periods, and is still taking place. Very important are also the investigations
which show how, for instance in such fundamentally
different groups as petrels and gulls, similar bionomic conditions have
produced step by step a marvellously close convergence, not only
in general appearance, but even in many details of structure.</p>

<p>Of the muscles of the hind-limbs likewise only a few can be mentioned.
The <i>ambiens</i> muscle, long and spindle-shaped, lying immediately
beneath the skin, extending from the pectineal process or
ilio-pubic spine to the knee, is the most median of the muscles of the
thigh. When typically developed its long tendon passes the knee-joint,
turning towards its outer side, and lastly, without being anywhere
attached to the knee, it forms one of the heads of the <i>flexor
perforatus digit</i>, ii. or iii. One of the functions of this peculiar
muscle (which is similarly developed in crocodiles, but absent, or not
differentiated from the ilio-tibial and ilio-femoral mass, in other
vertebrates) is that its contraction helps to close the second and
third toes. Too much has been made of this feature since Sir R.
Owen (<i>Cyclop. Anat. Phys</i>. i. p. 296, 1835), following G.A. Borelli
(<i>De motu animalium</i>, Rome, 1680), explained that birds are enabled
to grasp the twig on which they rest whilst sleeping, without having
to make any muscular exertion, because the weight of the body bends
the knee and ankle-joints, over both of which pass the tendons of this
compound muscle. There are many perching birds, <i>e.g</i>. all the
Passeres, which do not possess this muscle at all, whilst many of
those which have it fully developed, <i>e.g.</i> Anseres, can hardly
be said to &ldquo;perch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garrod went so far as to divide all the birds into <i>Homalogonatae</i>
and <i>Anomalogonatae</i>, according to the presence or absence of the
ambiens muscle. This resulted in a failure. To appreciate this,
it is sufficient to enumerate the birds without the critical muscle:
<i>Passeriformes</i> and <i>Coraciiformes</i>, without exception; <i>Ardeae</i> and
<i>Podiceps</i>; lastly various genera of storks, pigeons, parrots, petrels
and auks. The loss has taken place, and still takes place, independently
in widely different groups. It follows, first, that the
absence of this muscle does not always indicate relationship;
secondly that we can derive birds that are without it from a group
which still possess it, but not vice versa. The absence of the ambiens
muscle in all owls, which apparently use their feet in the same way
as the <i>Accipitres</i> (all of which possess it), indicates that owls are
not developed from the latter, but from a group which, like the other
<i>Coraciiformes</i>, had already lost their muscle.</p>

<p>Garrod further attributed much taxonomic value to the <i>caudilio-femoralis</i>
muscle (fig. 15). This, when fully developed, consists
of two parts, but inserted by a single ribbon-like tendon upon the
hinder surface of the femur, near the end of its first third; the caudal
part, <i>femoro-caudalis</i>, expressed by Garrod by the symbol <i>A</i>, arises
from transverse processes of the tail; the iliac part
(<i>accessoro-femoro-caudal</i> of Garrod, with the symbol <i>B</i>), arises mostly from the
outer surface of the postacetabular ilium. Of course this double-headed
condition is the more primitive, and as such exists in most
nidifugous birds, but in many of these, as well as in many nidicolous
birds, either the caudal or the iliac head is absent, and in a very
few (<i>Cancroma, Dicholophus, Steatornis</i> and some <i>Cathartes</i>) the whole
muscle is absent. The <i>caud-ilio flexorius</i> (<i>semitendinosus</i> of most
authors) arises from the transverse processes of the tail, and from
the distal half of the postacetabular ilium, thence passing as a broad
ribbon to the popliteal region, where it splits into two portions. One
of these, broad and fleshy, is inserted upon the posterior surface of
the distal third of the femur. This portion, morphologically the
original, was named the &ldquo;accessory semitendinosus&rdquo; with the
symbol <i>Y</i>; the other portion descends on the hinder aspect of the
leg and joins the fascia of the inner femoral head of the <i>gastrocnemius</i>
muscle. In many birds the insertion is shifted from the femur to
the neck of the tibia, in which case the &ldquo;accessory head&rdquo; is said to
be absent, a condition expressed by Garrod by the symbol <i>X</i>. By
combining the four symbols <i>A, B, X, Y</i>, according to their presence
or absence, Garrod got a considerable number of formulae, each
of which was overruled, so to speak, by the two categories of the
presence or absence of the <i>ambiens</i> muscle. It needs hardly to
be pointed out why such a purely mechanical scheme was doomed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page966" id="page966"></a>966</span>
failure. Its author, with a considerable mathematical and mechanical
bias, reckoned entirely with the quantity, not with the quality
of his units, and relied almost implicitly upon his formulae. It is,
however, fair to state that his system was not built entirely upon
these muscular variations, but rather upon a more laborious combination
of anatomical characters, which were so selected that they
presumably could not stand in direct correlation with each other,
notably the oil-gland, caeca, carotids, nasal bones and above all, the
muscles of the thigh. He was, indeed, the first to show clearly the
relationship of the heron-like birds with the Steganopodes; of stork-like
birds with the American vultures; the great difference between
the latter and the other birds of prey; the connexion of the gulls
and auks with the plovers, and that of the sand-grouse with the
pigeons&mdash;discoveries expressed in the new terms of the orders
Ciconiiformes and Charadriiformes. These are instances, now well
understood, that almost every organic system, even when studied
by itself, may yield valuable indications as to the natural affinities
of the various groups of birds. That Garrod has so very much
advanced the classification of birds is ultimately due to his comprehensive
anatomical knowledge and general insight.</p>

<p class="pt2">To return to these thigh muscles. The most primitive combination,
ambiens and <i>A B X Y</i>, is the most common; next follows
that of <i>A X Y</i>, meaning the reduction of <i>B</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the iliac portion
of the <i>caud-ilio-femoralis</i>; <i>A B X</i> and <i>B X Y</i> are less common;
<i>A X</i> and <i>X Y</i> are rare and occur only in smaller groups, as in subfamilies
or genera; <i>B X</i> occurs only in <i>Podiceps</i>. But the greatest
reduction, with only <i>A</i> remaining, is characteristic of such a heterogeneous
assembly as Accipitres, Cypselidae. Trochilidae, Striges and
Fregata. This fact alone is sufficient proof that these conditions,
or rather reductions, have been acquired independently of the various
groups. <i>A B Y</i>, <i>A Y</i>, <i>A B</i>, <i>X Y</i> and <i>B</i> do not occur at all,
some of them for obvious reasons. Occasionally there is an instructive
progressive evolution expressed in these formula; for instance
<i>Phaethon</i>, in various other respects the lowest of the Steganopodes,
has <i>A X Y</i>, <i>Sula</i> and <i>Phalacrocorax</i> have <i>A X</i>, <i>Fregata</i>, the most
specialized of these birds, has arrived at the reduced formula <i>A</i>.
Further, the combinations <i>B X Y</i> and <i>A X Y</i> cannot be derived
from each other, but both directly from <i>A B X Y</i> in two different
directions. Keeping this in mind, we may fairly conclude that the
flamingo with <i>B X Y</i> points to an ancestral condition <i>A B X Y</i>,
which is still represented by <i>Platalea</i> and <i>Ibis</i>, whilst the other storks
proper have taken a different line, leading to <i>A X Y</i>.</p>

<p><i>Brain.</i>&mdash;The more characteristic features of the bird&rsquo;s brain
show clearly a further development of the reptilian type, not
always terminal features in a direct line, but rather side-departures,
sometimes even a secondary sinking to a lower level,
and in almost every case in a direction away from those fundamentally
reptilian lines which have led to the characters typical
of, and peculiar to, the mammals.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The forebrain forms the bulk of the whole brain, but the large size
of the hemispheres is due to the greater development of the basal
and lateral portions (<i>pedunculi cerebri</i> and <i>corpora striata</i>), while the
pallium (the portion external to the lateral ventricles) is thin, and
restricted to the median side of each hemisphere. As a direct result
of this undoubtedly secondary reduction of the pallium&mdash;due to the
excessive preponderance of the basal and lateral parts&mdash;the corpus
callosum (<i>i.e.</i> the transverse commissure of the right and left pallium)
is in birds reduced to a narrow flat bundle of a few white fibres; it
is situated immediately above and behind the much stronger anterior
commissure, <i>i.e.</i> the connexion between the corpora striata, or chief
remaining part of the hemispheres. Owing to the small size of the
olfactory lobes the anterior arms of the latter commissure are wanting.
There is very little grey matter in the cortex of the hemispheres,
the surface of which is devoid of convolutions, mostly quite smooth;
in others, for instance pigeons, fowls and birds of prey, a very slight
furrow might be compared with the Sylvian fissure.</p>

<p>The Thalamencephalon is much reduced. The epiphysis, or pineal
body, is quite as degenerate as in mammals, although still forming
a long stalk as in reptiles. In birds, this stalk consists entirely of
blood-vessels, which in the adult enclose no terminal vesicle, and fuse
with the membranous linings of the skull. The midbrain is represented
chiefly by the optic lobes, the cortex of which alone is homologous
with the <i>corpora quadragemina</i> of the mammals. Their
transverse dorsal connexion is the posterior commissure; otherwise
the whole roof portion of the midbrain is reduced to a thin membrane,
continuous with that which covers the Sylvian aqueduct, and this
ventricle sends a lateral cavity into each optic lobe, as is the case in
reptiles. The right and left lobes themselves are rent asunder (so
to speak), so that they are freely visible from above, filling the
corners formed by the hemispheres and the cerebellum. The latter
is, in comparison with mammals; represented by its middle portion
only, the <i>vermis</i>; in a sagittal section it shows an extremely well
developed <i>arbor vitae</i>, produced by the transverse, repeated folding
of the whole organ. In comparison with reptiles the cerebellum of
birds shows high development. Forwards it covers, and has driven
asunder, the optic lobes; backwards it hides the much shortened
medulla oblongata.</p>

<p>Several futile attempts have been made to draw conclusions as
to the intelligence of various birds, from comparison of the weight
of the whole brain with that of the body, or the weight of the hemispheres
with that of other parts of the central nervous system.</p>

<p>The <i>brachial plexus</i> is formed by four or five of the lowest cervical
nerves; the last nerve of this plexus often marks the boundary of
the cervical and thoracic vertebrae. The composition of the plexus
varies much, not only in different species, but even individually.
The most careful observations are those by Fürbringer. The serial
number of these nerves depends chiefly upon the length of the neck,
the extremes being represented by <i>Cypselus</i> (10th-14th cervical) and
<i>Cygnus</i> (22nd-24th), the usual numbers of the common fowl being
the 13th-17th nerves.</p>

<p>The <i>Crural Plexus</i> is divided into a crural, ischiadic and pubic
portion. The first is generally composed of three nerves, the hindmost
of which, the <i>furcalis</i>, issues in most birds between the last two
lumbo-sacral vertebrae, and then divides, one half going to the
crural, the other to the sciatic portions. The <i>obturatorius</i> nerve
invariably comes from the two main stems of the crural. The
ischiadic portion consists generally of five or six nerves, which leave
the pelvis as one thick system through the ilio-ischiadic foramen.
The last nerve which contributes to the ischiadic plexus leaves the
spinal column in most birds either between the two primary sacral
vertebrae, or just below the hindmost of them, and sends a branch
to the pubic portion which is composed of post-ischiadic nerves,
partly imbedded in the kidneys, and innervates the ventral muscles
between the tail and pubis, together with those of the cloaca and
copulatory organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page967" id="page967"></a>967</span></p>

<p>The <i>Sympathetic System</i> forms a chain on either side of the vertebral
column. In the region of the neck lateral strands pass through
the transverse canal of the cervical vertebrae; but from the thoracic
region onwards, where the cardiac branch to the heart is given off,
each strand is double and the basal ganglia are successively connected
with the next by a branch which runs ventrally over the
capitulum of the rib, and by another which passes directly through
the foramen or space formed between capitulum and tuberculum.
In the pelvic region, from about the level of the posterior end of the
ischiadic plexus, the strand of each side becomes single again, passing
ventrally over the transverse processes. Lastly, towards the caudal
region the right and left strands approach and anastomose, eventually
coalescing in the mid line.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">4. <i>Organs of Sense.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Eye</i> is essentially reptilian, but in sharpness of vision,
power and quickness of accommodation it surpasses that of the
mammals. The eyeball, instead of being globular, resembles
rather the tube of a short and thick opera-glass.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The anterior half of the sclerotic is composed of a ring of some ten
to seventeen cartilaginous or bony scales which partly overlap each
other. Another cartilage or ossification, the posterior sclerotic
ring, occurs within the walls of the posterior portion of the cup,
and surrounds, especially in the Pici and in the Passeres, the entrance
of the optic nerve. The iris is in most young birds at first brown or
dull-coloured, but with maturity attains often very bright tints which
add considerably to the charm of the bird; sexual dimorphism is
in this respect of common occurrence. The iris contains a sphincter
and a dilator muscle; the former, supplied by branches from the
<i>oculomotorius</i> nerve, is under control of the will, whilst the dilator
fibres belong to the sympathetic system. When fully dilated, the
pupil is round in all birds; when contracted it is usually round,
rarely oval as in the fowl. From near the entrance of the optic
nerve, through the original choroidal fissure, arises the much-folded
pecten, deeply pigmented and very vascular, far into the vitreous
humour. The number of its folds varies considerably, from three in
<i>Caprimulgus</i> to nearly thirty in crow (<i>Corvus</i>). <i>Apteryx</i>, which
since Owen has generally been stated to be devoid of such an organ,
likewise possesses a pecten; its base is, however, trumpet-shaped,
covers almost the whole of the optic disk, and extends nearly to the
lens in the shape of a thick, densely pigmented cone, without any
plications, resembling in these respects the pecten of many Lacertilia
(see G.L. Johnson, <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1901, p. 54). In the retina the
cones prevail in numbers over the rods as in the mammals, and their
tips contain, as in other Sauropsida, coloured drops of oil, mostly
red or yellow. Near the posterior pole of the fundus, but somewhat
excentrically placed towards the temporal or outer side, is the <i>fovea
centralis</i>, a slight depression in the retina, composed almost entirely
of cones, the spot of most acute vision. Many birds possess besides
this temporal fovea a second fovea nearer the nasal side. It is
supposed that the latter serves monocular, the other the binocular
vision, most birds being able to converge their eyes upon one spot.
Consequently the whole field of vision of these birds possesses three
points where vision is most acute. It may here be remembered that
of the mammalia man and monkeys alone are capable of convergence,
and have a circumscribed macular area.</p>

<p>Of the outer eyelids, the lower alone is movable in most birds, as
in reptiles, and it frequently contains a rather large saucer-shaped
cartilage, the <i>tarsus palpebralis</i>. The margins of the lids are sometimes
furnished with eyelashes, <i>e.g</i>. in the ostrich and in the Amazon
parrots, which are vestigial feathers without barbs. During the
embryonic stage the lids are fused together, and either become
separated shortly before the bird is hatched, as is the case with most
Nidifugae, or else the blind condition prevails for some time, in
the young Nidicolae. All birds have, like most reptiles, a well-developed
third lid or &ldquo;nictitating membrane,&rdquo; which moves from
the inner canthus obliquely upwards and backwards over the cornea.
The moving mechanism is a further and much higher development
of that which prevails in reptiles, there being two muscles completely
separate from each other. Both are supplied by the <i>abducens</i>
nerve, together with the <i>rectus externus</i> muscle. One, the <i>quadratus</i>
or <i>bursalis</i> muscle, arises from the hinder surface of the eyeball, and
forms with its narrow margin, which is directed towards the optic
nerve, a pulley for the long tendon of the <i>pyramidalis</i> muscle. This
arises from the nasal surface of the ball, and its tendon passes into
the somewhat imperfectly transparent nictitating membrane. The
quadrate muscle adjusts the motion, and prevents pressure upon
the optic nerve; during the state of relaxation of both muscles
the nictitans withdraws through its own elasticity.</p>

<p><i>Ear.</i>&mdash;The outer opening of the ear is, with rare exceptions,
concealed by feathers, which are often rather stiff, or modified
into bristles. There is no other protection, but slight, imperfectly
movable folds of skin arise from the outer rim. The
largest ear-opening is met with in the owls, with correspondingly
larger folds of skin, the function of which is less that of protection
than, probably, the catching of sound. In many owls the right
and left ears are asymmetrical, and this asymmetry affects the
whole of the temporal region, all the bones which surround the
outer and middle ear, notably the squamosal and the quadrate,
so that the skull becomes lopsided, one ear being turned obliquely
down, the other upwards. (For, detail see Collett,
<i>Christiania Vidensk. Forhandl.</i>, 1881, No. 3.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The middle ear communicates with the mouth by the Eustachian
tubes, which pass between the basisphenoid and basioccipital bones,
and unite upon the ventral side of the sphenoid, a little behind its
articulation with the pterygoids, where they open into the mouth
cavity by a short membranous duct. The columellar apparatus,
or auditory chain of ossicles (fig. 16), extending between the fenestra
ovalis and the tympanic membrane or
drum, consists of (1) the long and slender
columella, a straight, ossified rod
which fits with a disk into the fenestra
ovalis; it is homologous with the
stapes (<i>m.st.</i>), although not stirrup-shaped;
(2) the extracolumellar mass.
This is chiefly cartilaginous and sends
out three processes: the dorsal (<i>s.st.</i>)
is attached to the upper wall of the
drum cavity; the outermost (<i>e.st.</i>) is
fastened on to the middle of the drum
membrane; the third, ventral or infracolumellar
process (<i>i.st.</i>) is directed
downwards and tapers out into a thin,
partly cartilaginous, strand, which
originally extended to the inner corner
of the articular portion of the mandible,
but on its long way comes to
grief, being squeezed in between the
pterygoid and quadrate. This long
downward process being homologous
with an almost exactly identical arrangement
in the crocodile, and with the
<i>processus folii</i> of the mammalian
malleus, it follows that the whole
extracolumellar mass, that between
stapes and drum, is equivalent to incus and malleus of the mammalia.
There is, in birds, no <i>annulus tympanicus</i>. Birds possess
an ear-muscle which at least acts as a <i>tensor tympani</i>; it arises near
the occipital condyle, passes through a hole into the tympanic
cavity, and its tendon is, in various ways, attached to the inside of
the membrane and the neighbouring extracolumellar processes.</p>

<p>As regards the inner ear, the endolymphatic duct ends in a closed
<i>saccus</i>, imbedded in the dura mater of the cranial cavity. The apex
of the cochlea is turned towards, and almost reaches the anterior
wall of the occipital condyle; at most it makes but half a twist or
turn; it possesses both Reissner&rsquo;s membrane and the organ of
Corti. Although the <i>scala tympani</i> is so rudimentary, not reaching
a higher level than in most of the reptiles, and remaining far below
the mammalia, birds do not only hear extremely well, but they
distinguish between and &ldquo;understand&rdquo; pitch, notes and melodies.</p>

<p><i>Nose.</i>&mdash;The olfactory organ is poorly developed, and it is
still a question whether birds possess much power of smell;
many are certainly devoid of it.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The olfactory perceptive membrane is restricted to the posterior
innermost region of the nasal chamber, where it covers a slight
bulging-out prominence on the nasal wall. This so-called third,
upper or posterior conch is not a true conch, nor is that of the
vestibulum; only the middle one forms a scroll, and this corresponds
to the only one of reptiles and the lower of the mammals. The
nasal cavity communicates with the mouth by the choanae or
posterior nares, situated between the palatine process of the maxillary,
the palatine and the vomer. The outer nares or nostrils are
most variable in size and shape. In the Steganopodes they tend
to become much reduced, <i>e.g.</i> in cormorants (<i>Phalacrocoracidae</i>),
and especially in <i>Sula</i>, where the nasal slits become completely
closed up, and the greater portion of the nasal cavity is also abolished,
being restricted to the olfactory region with its unusually wide
choanae. The nasal septum is often more or less incomplete, producing
<i>nares peniae</i>, <i>e.g.</i> in the Cathartae, in the Anseres, gulls,
rails and various other aquatic birds. The secretions of the mucous
membrane of the nasal cavity, and a pair of naso-lacrymal glands
(not to be confounded with the Harderian and the lacrymal glands),
moisten and clean the chamber. The glands are variable in size
and position; when very large, <i>e.g.</i> in plovers, they extend upon
the forehead, causing deep impressions on the bones of the skull.
Jacobson&rsquo;s organ has been lost by the birds, apparently without a
trace in the embryonic fowl, but T.J. Parker has described vestiges
of the corresponding cartilages in the <i>Apteryx</i> (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1890).</p>

</div>

<p class="pt2 center">5. <i>Vascular System.</i></p>

<p>The <i>heart</i> lies in the middle line of the body, its long axis
being parallel with that of the trunk. The whole ventral surface
of the pericardium is exposed when the sternum is removed. The
right and left halves are completely divided by septa, no mixture
of the venous and arterial blood being possible, an advance upon
reptilian conditions, even the highest.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The atria are comparatively small, the walls being thin, especially
those of the right, which possesses numerous muscular ridges projecting
into the cavity presenting a honeycombed appearance. The
interauricular septum is mostly entirely membranous; in the middle
it is thinner, rather transparent, but there is no depression or <i>fossa
ovalis</i>. The whole sinus venosus has become part of the right atrium.
It receives the three great venous trunks of the body, namely the
<i>vena cava superior dextra</i>, the <i>vena cava superior sinistra</i> more dorsally,
and the <i>vena cava inferior</i> more to the right and below; the
opening of the last is guarded by two prominent valves in place of
the mammalian <i>valvula Eustachii</i>. The right ventricle occupies the
ventral portion of the heart. The communication with the atrium
is guarded by a <i>valvula cardiaca dextra</i>, which only in function represents
the mammalian tricuspid; it consists of an oblique reduplication
of the muscular fibres together with the endocardiac
lining of the right ventricle, while the opposite wall is convex and
forms neither a velum nor papillary muscles, nor <i>chordae tendineae</i>.
The right anterior corner of the right ventricle passes into the short
stem, guarded by three semi-lunar valves, which divides into the
two pulmonary arteries. There are likewise two pulmonary veins,
entering the left atrium by one orifice. Two or three membranous
flaps, held by numerous <i>chordae tendineae</i>, form a true mitral valve,
and allow the blood to pass through the left <i>ostium atrioventriculare</i>.
The blood leaves the heart past three semi-lunar valves, by the
<i>right</i> aorta, this being alone functional, a feature characteristic of,
and peculiar to, birds. Remnants of the left aortic arch persist sometimes
in the shape of a ligamentous strand. The aortic trunk is very
short, sends off the coronary arteries and then the left <i>aorta brachiocephalica</i>,
while the rest divides into the right brachiocephalic and
the <i>aorta descendens</i>. Each brachiocephalic soon sends off its subclavian,
while in the normal or more usual cases the rest proceeds
as the carotid trunk, inclusive of the vertebral artery. But the
carotids show several interesting modifications which have been
examined chiefly by C.L. Nitzsch and by A.H. Garrod. (1) The
right and left carotids converge towards the middle and extend up
the neck, imbedded in a furrow along the ventral surface of the
cervical vertebrae. This is the usual arrangement. (2) The two
carotids are fused into one <i>carotis conjuncta</i>, imbedded in a special
median osseous semicanal of the vertebrae; <i>e.g.</i> herons, flamingos,
and some parrots. (3) There is one <i>carotis conjuncta</i>, but the basal
portion of its original right component is obliterated, leaving a so-called
<i>c. primaria sinistra</i>, an unfortunate name. Such <i>Aves laevocarotidinae</i>
of Garrod are common, <i>e.g.</i> all the Passeriformes. (4)
The reverse of the third modification, producing a <i>c. primaria
dextra</i> in the bustard <i>Eupodotis</i>. In other likewise very rare cases
a left, or a left and right, superficial carotids are developed and take
the place of the then vanished deep or primary carotids.</p>

<p><i>Venous System.</i>&mdash;The bird&rsquo;s liver receives nearly all the blood from
the stomach, gut, pancreas and spleen, as well as from the left liver
itself, into the right hepatic lobe, by a right and left portal vein.
The <i>venae hepaticae magnae</i> join the <i>vena cava posterior</i> and thereby
form with it the <i>vena cava inferior</i>. The left <i>hepatica magna</i> receives
also the umbilical vein, which persists on the visceral surface of the
abdominal wall, often anastomosing with the epigastric veins. A
likewise unpaired vena <i>coccygeo-mesenterica</i> is usually present. There
is no renal portal system, excepting unimportant vestiges of such
a system in the head kidneys.</p>

<p><i>Lymphatic System.</i>&mdash;The white blood-corpuscles are produced in
the follicles at the base of the intestinal villi. The lymph vessels
of the tail and hinder parts of the body enter the hypogastric veins;
and at the point of junction, on either side, lies a small lymph heart,
which often persists until maturity. The red blood-corpuscles are invariably
oval disks, with a central nucleus which causes a slight
swelling; hence they are oval and biconvex.</p>

</div>

<p class="pt2 center">6. <i>Respiratory System.</i></p>

<p>The <i>lungs</i> are small and occupy only the dorsal portion of
the thoracic cavity. There is only one right and one left lobe,
each traversed through its whole length by a <i>mesobronchium</i>,
whence arise about ten secondary bronchia; these send off
radially arranged <i>parabronchia</i>, which end blindly near the
surface. The walls of these tertiary tubes send out, in all directions,
<i>canaliculi aeriferi</i> which, ending in slight swellings, recall
the mammalian <i>aveoli</i>.</p>

<p>Highly specialized air-sacs are characteristic of all birds. They
are very thin-walled membranes, very poor in blood-vessels,
formed by the bulged-out pleural or peritoneal covering of the
lungs, through the parabronchial tubes of which they are filled
with air. Their function is not quite clear. The usual suggestion,
that the warm air contained within them assists the bird
in flight, balloon-like, is absurd. They assist in the extremely
rapid and vigorous ventilation of the lungs, the latter being
capable of but very limited expansion and contraction in birds.
Exchange of gas through the walls of the air-sacs, almost devoid
of blood-vessels, can at best be much restricted.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are five pairs of larger sacs belonging to the pulmonary
system:&mdash;(1) prebronchial or cervical, extending sometimes far up
the neck, even into the cranial cavities; the throat-bags of the
prairie fowls (<i>Cupidonia</i> and <i>Pedioecetes</i>) are a further development;
(2) subbronchial or interclavicular; (3 and 4) anterior and posterior
thoracic or intermediate; (5) abdominal sacs. Most of these extend
through narrow apertures&mdash;<i>foramina pneumatica</i>&mdash;into the hollow
bones, sometimes, <i>e.g.</i> in hornbills and screamers, into every part
of the skeleton, or, in the shape of innumerable pneumatic cells,
even beneath the skin. There is also a naso-pharyngeal or tympanic
system of air-sacs, restricted to the head (cf. the <i>siphonium</i>
described in connexion with the mandible), but filling also such
curious organs as the frontal excrescence of <i>Chasmorhynchus</i>, the
Brazilian bell-bird, the throat-bag of the adjutant stork, and the
gular pouch of the bustard.</p>

<p>The <i>trachea</i> or windpipe is strengthened by numerous cartilaginous,
often osseous, complete rings, but in the emeu several of these rings
are incomplete in the medioventral line, and permit the inner lining
of the trachea to bulge out into a large neck-pouch, which is used by
both sexes as a resounding bag. In humming-birds and petrels the
trachea is partly divided by a vertical, longitudinal, cartilaginous
septum. In some of those birds which have a peculiarly harsh or
trumpeting voice, the trachea is lengthened, forming loops which
lie subcutaneously (capercally, curassow), or it enters and dilates
the symphysis of the furcula (crested guineafowl); or, <i>e.g.</i> in the
cranes and in the hooper swan, even the whole crest of the sternum
becomes invaded by the much elongated, manifolded trachea.</p>

<p>The <i>syrinx</i> or lower larynx is the most interesting and absolutely
avine modification, although absent as a voice-producing organ
(probably due to retrogression) in most Ratitae, storks, turkey
buzzards (<i>Cathartes</i>) and Steganopodes. The syrinx is a modification
of the lower part of the trachea and of the adjoining bronchi.
Essential are vibrating membranes between the cartilaginous framework,
and next, special muscles for regulating the tension. The
majority of birds possess a pair of internal tympaniform membranes
forming the inner or median walls of the bronchi, which are there
furnished with semi-rings only. External tympaniform membranes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page969" id="page969"></a>969</span>
exist, with great variations, between the specialized one or two
last tracheal and some of the first bronchial rings.</p>

<p>According to the position of the chief sound-producing membranes,
three types of syrinx are distinguishable:&mdash;(1) Tracheo-bronchial,
by far the commonest form, of which the two others are to a certain
extent modifications. The essential feature is that the proximal
end of the inner membranes is attached to the last pair of tracheal
rings; outer tympaniform membranes exist generally between the
2nd, 3rd and 4th bronchial semi-rings. This type attains its highest
development in the Oscines, but it occurs also in many other orders.
(2) Syrinx <i>bronchialis</i>. The outer membranes are spread out between
two or more successive bronchial semi-rings, a distance from the
trachea which is, in typical cases, devoid of sounding membranes;
some Cuculi, Caprimulgi, and some owls. (3) Syrinx <i>trachealis</i>. The
lower portion of the trachea consists of thin membranes, about half
a dozen of the rings being very thin or deficient. Inner and outer
membranes may exist on the bronchi. The <i>Tracheophonae</i> among
the Passeriformes, the possessors of this specialized although low
type of syrinx, form a tolerably well-marked group, entirely neotropical.
But indications of such a syrinx occur also in <i>Pittidae</i>,
pigeons and gallinaceous birds (<i>Gallidae</i>), the last cases being clearly
analogous.</p>

<p>Whilst the type of syrinx affords no help in classification, it is very
different with its muscles. These&mdash;as indicated by their supply
from a branch of the hypoglossal nerve, which descends on either
side of the trachea&mdash;are, so to speak, a detached, now mostly independent
colony of glosso-pharyngeal muscles. Omitting the paired
tracheo-clavicular muscles, we restrict ourselves to the syringeal
proper, those which extend between tracheal and bronchial rings.
Their numbers vary from one pair to seven, and they are inserted
either upon the middle portion of the bronchial semi-rings (<i>Mesomyodi</i>),
or upon the ends of these semi-rings where these pass into
the inner tympaniform membrane (<i>Acromyodi</i>). The former is
morphologically the more primitive condition, and is found in the
overwhelming majority of birds, including many Passeriformes.
The acromyodian type is restricted almost entirely to the Oscines.
Further, according to these muscles being inserted only upon the
dorsal, or only upon the ventral, or on both ends of the semi-rings,
we distinguish between <i>an</i>-, <i>kat</i>- and <i>diacromyodi</i>. But the distinction
between such <i>Acromyodi</i> and the <i>Mesomyodi</i> is not always
safe. For instance, the <i>Tyranninae</i> are anacromyod, while the
closely allied Pipras and Cotingas are katacromyod; both these
modifications can be shown to have been derived but recently from
the weak meso- and oligomyodian condition which prevails in
the majority of the so-called <i>Oligomyodi</i>. On the other hand, the
diacromyodian type can have been developed only from a strong
muscular basis which could split into a dorsal and a ventral mass;
moreover, no Passeres are known to be intermediate between those
that are diacromyodian and those that are not.</p>

<p>Attempts to derive the anacromyodian and the katacromyodian
from the diacromyodian condition are easy on paper, but quite hopeless
when hampered by the knowledge of anatomical facts and how
to use them. There remains but one logical way, namely, to distinguish
as follows:&mdash;(1) <i>Passeres anisomyodi</i>, in which the syrinx
muscles are unequally inserted, either on the middle or on one end
of the semi-rings, either dorsal or ventral. This type comprises the
Clamatores. (2) <i>Passeres diacromyodi</i>, in which some of the syrinx
muscles are attached to the dorsal, and some to the ventral ends,
those ends being, so to say, equally treated. This type comprises
the Oscines. Both types represent rather two divergent lines than
successive stages, although that of the Clamatores remains at a
lower level, possessing at the utmost three pairs of muscles, whilst
these range in the Oscines from rarely two or three to five or seven.</p>

<p>This way of using the characters of the syrinx for the classification
of the Passeriformes seems simple, but it took a long time to accomplish.
Joh. Müller introduced the terms <i>Polymyodi</i> and <i>Tracheaphones</i>,
Huxley that of <i>Oligomyodi</i>; Müller himself had, moreover,
pointed out the more important characters of the mode of insertion,
but it was Garrod who invented the corresponding terms of <i>Acro</i>-
and <i>Mesomyodi</i> (= <i>Tracheophones</i> + <i>Oligomyodi</i>). (For further historical
detail, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ornithology</a></span>). After W.A. Forbes had investigated
such important genera as <i>Philepitta</i> and <i>Xenicus</i>, P.L. Sclater,
A. Newton and R.B. Sharpe divided the Passeres respectively into
<i>Oscines, Oligomyodae, Tracheophonae</i> and <i>Pseudoscines</i> (=<i>Suboscines</i>);
<i>Oligomyodae, Tracheophonae</i> and <i>Acromyodae; Oscines, Oligomyodae,
Tracheophonae</i> and <i>Atrichiidae</i>. Ignoring the fact that some <i>Oligomyodae</i>
are meso- and others acromyodian, they tried to combine two
irreconcilable principles, namely, mere numbers against quality.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">7. <i>Digestive System</i>.</p>

<p>For a general account of the digestive organs, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alimentary
Canal</a></span>. Here only a few peculiar features may be mentioned.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The young pigeons are fed by both parents with a peculiar stuff,
the product of the strongly proliferating epithelial cells of the crop,
which cells undergo a cheese-like fatty degeneration, and mixed with
mucus, perhaps also with the proventricular juice, make up a milk-like
fluid. Should the young die or be removed during this period,
the parents are liable to die, suffering severely from the turgid
congestion of the hypertrophied walls of the crop.</p>

<p>The male of the hornbills, <i>Bucerotinae</i>, feeds his mate, which is
imprisoned, or walled-up in a hollow tree, during the whole time of
incubation, by regorging his food. This bolus is surrounded, as by
a bag, by the cast-up lining of the gizzard. Since this process is
repeated for many days the habitual reaction of the stomach well-nigh
exhausts the male. A graphic account of this is given in
Livingstone&rsquo;s travels.</p>

<p>The hoactzin, <i>Opisthocomus</i>, feeds to a great extent upon the
leaves of the aroid <i>Montrichardia</i> or <i>Caladium arborescens</i>. The
crop is modified into a large and very rugose triturating apparatus,
while the gizzard, thereby relieved of its function, is reduced to the
utmost. The large and heavy crop has caused a unique modification of
the sternal apparatus. The keel is pushed back to the distal third
of the sternum, whilst the original anterior margin of the keel is correspondingly
elongated, and the furcula fused with the rostral portion.</p>

<p>In the ostrich, <i>Struthio</i>, the craze of overloading the stomach with
pebbles which, when triturated into sand, are not voided, has brought
about a dislocation, so that the enormously widened and stretched
space between proventriculus and gizzard forms a bag, directed
downwards, whilst the gizzard itself with part of the duodenum is
rotated round its axis to more than 100°. A similar rotation and
dislocation occurs in various petrels, in correlation with the indigestible
sepia-bills, &amp;c., which these birds swallow in great quantities.
In <i>Plotus</i>, the snakebird, the pyloric chamber of the stomach
is beset with a mass of hair-like stiff filaments which permit nothing
but fluid to pass into the duodenum. The gizzard of various birds
which are addicted to eating hairy caterpillars, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Cuculus canorus</i>
and trogons, is often lined with the broken-off hairs of these caterpillars,
which, penetrating the cuticle, assume a regular spiral
arrangement, due to the rotatory motion of the muscles of the
gizzard.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">8. <i>Cloaca and Genital Organs</i>.</p>

<p>The cloaca is divided by transverse circular folds, which project
from its inner walls, into three successive chambers. The innermost,
the coprodaeum, is an oval dilatation of the end of the rectum,
and attains its greatest size in those birds whose faeces are very
fluid; it serves entirely as the temporary receptacle of the faeces
and the urine. The next chamber, the urodaeum, is small, and
receives in its dorso-lateral wall the ureters and the genital ducts;
above and below this chamber is closed by circular folds, the lower
of which, towards the ventral side, passes into the coating of the
copulatory organ when such is present. The urodaeum serves only
as a passage, the urine being mixed with the faeces in the chamber
above. The third or outermost chamber, the proctodaeum, is
closed externally by the sphincter ani; the orifice is quite circular.
It lodges the copulatory organ, and on its dorsal wall lies the <i>bursa
Fabricii</i>, an organ peculiar to birds. It is most developed in the
young of both sexes, is of unknown function, and becomes more or
less obliterated in the adult. Only in the ostrich it remains throughout
life, being specialized into a large receptacle for the urine, an
absolutely unique arrangement. A true urinary bladder, <i>i.e</i>. a
ventral dilatation of the urodaeum, is absent in all birds. It is
significant that the whole type of their cloaca much resembles that
of the Crocodilia and Chelonia, in opposition to that of the Lacertilia.</p>

<p>The penis, and its much reduced vestige of the female, is developed
from the ventral wall of the proctodaeum. It occurs in two different
forms. In the Ratitae, except <i>Rhea</i>, it consists mainly of a right
and left united half (<i>corpora fibrosa</i>), with a deep longitudinal furrow
on the dorsal side, and much resembles the same organ in crocodiles
and tortoises. It is protruded and retracted by special muscles
which are partly attached to the ventral, distal end of the ilium.
Another type exists in <i>Rhea</i> and in the <i>Anseriformes</i>, greatly specialized
by being spirally twisted and partly reversible like the finger of
a glove. This is mainly due to the greater development of an unpaired,
median portion, analogous to the mammalian <i>corpus spongiosum</i>,
which is much less prominent in the Ratitae; the muscles
of this type are derived solely from the anal sphincter. In other
Carinatae, <i>e.g</i>. tinamous and storks, the penis is very much smaller
and simpler, with every appearance of a degenerated organ. In the
great majority of birds it has disappeared completely and the primitive
way of everting the cloaca is resorted to.</p>

<p>Both right and left testes are functional. They become greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page970" id="page970"></a>970</span>
enlarged in the breeding season; in the sparrow, for instance, from
the size of a mustard seed to that of a small cherry. The vas
deferens descends with many undulations down the lateral side of
the ureter of the same side, and opens upon a small papilla into the
urodaeum. Extraordinary increase in length during the breeding
season causes the vasa deferentia in some of the African weaver-birds
to protrude, or to bulge out the cloacal walls beyond the vent.
The spermatozoa exhibit many differences in shape, size and proportions,
in the various groups of birds. They have been studied
minutely by E. Ballowitz.</p>

<p>Only the left ovary becomes functional, with rare individual exceptions.
Both present the appearance of diminutive clusters of
grapes, at the anterior end of the kidneys, close to the suprarenal
bodies, separated from each other by the descending aorta and by the
vena cava where this is formed by the right and left <i>vena iliaca
communis</i>. During the breeding season many more eggs are developed
than reach maturity, amounting in most birds to several
dozens. Those germs which do not ripen during the season undergo
a process of resorption, and in the winter the whole ovary
dwindles to often a diminutive size. In young birds both oviducts
are almost equal in size, but the right soon degenerates into an
insignificant strand. During every laying season the left duct increases
enormously by new formation of its component fibres. For
instance, in the fowl its volume increases about fifty-fold, growing
from some 6 in. in length and scarcely one line in width to more than
2 ft. in length and ½ in. in thickness. The upper, wide opening of
the duct is attached by elastic, peritoneal lamellae to the hinder
margin of the left lung; the middle portion of the duct is glandular
and thick-walled, for the deposition of the albumen; it is connected
by a short, constricted &ldquo;isthmus&rdquo; (where the shell-membrane is
formed) with a dilated &ldquo;uterus&rdquo; in which the egg receives its calcareous
shell and eventual pigmentation.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">B. Fossil Birds</p>

<p>Much had naturally been expected from the study of fossil
birds, but, so far as the making of classifications is concerned,
they have proved rather a source of perplexities. So long as
the characters of new fossils are only of specific and generic
value, it is mostly possible to assign the birds to their proper
place, but when these characters indicate new families or orders,
for instance Hesperornithes, Ichthyornithes, Palaelodi, their
owners are put outside the more tersely constructed classifications
applicable to modern birds. It is no exaggeration to say that
the genus, often even the species, can be determined from almost
any recent bone, but in the case of Miocene, and still more, of
Eocene fossils, we have often to deal with strange families, which
either represent an extinct side branch, or which connect several
recent groups with each other. Our artificially-established
classifications collapse whilst we gain further insight into the
mutual affinities of the existing groups. Of course this must be
so if evolution is true. But it also follows that, if every extinct
and recent bird were known, neither species, nor genera, nor
families, nor orders could be defined. We should be able to
construct the pedigree of every group, in other words, the
gigantic natural system, but there would be no classification.
Much light has also been thrown by fossil birds upon the study
of geographical distribution. The key to the distribution of
recent groups lies in that of the extinct forms. Not only have
many absolutely new families been discovered, but many kinds
of modern birds are now known to have existed also in countries
which they are now extinct. There were, for instance, trogons,
secretary-birds, parrots, and other now Ethiopian forms in
Miocene France. Ostriches, undistinguishable from <i>Struthio</i>,
have been found in Samos and in the Sivalik Hills.</p>

<p>The proper study of fossil birds may be said to have begun
with A. Milne-Edwards, whose magnificent <i>Oiseaux fossiles de la
France</i> was published from 1867 to 1871. This work deals chiefly
with mid-Tertiary forms. A new impetus was given by O.C.
Marsh, who, after 1870, discovered a great number of bird
remains in the Cretaceous strata of North America. The most
important result is the proof that, until the end of the Cretaceous
epoch, most, if not all, birds were still possessed of teeth (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Odontornithes</a></span>).</p>

<p>The oldest known bird is the <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), of the upper
Oolite in Bavaria. The imprints in the enormously older new
red sandstone or Lower Trias of Connecticut, and originally
named <i>Ornithichnites</i>, belong to Dinosaurian Reptiles.</p>

<p>A wide gap separates <i>Archaeopteryx</i> from the next order
of fossil birds of the Cretaceous epoch, and, since freshwater
deposits of that age are rare, bird remains are uncommon.
Many bones formerly referred to birds have since proved to
belong to Pterodactyls, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Cimoliornis</i> from the English Chalk.
But in 1858 were discerned in the Upper Greensand of Cambridgeshire
remains which are now known as <i>Enaliornis</i>. W. Dames
has described bones from the Chalk of southern Sweden under
the name of <i>Scaniornis</i>, probably allied to <i>Palaelodus</i>. From
the Cretaceous rocks of North America a large number of birds
have been described by O.C. Marsh. Of these the most interesting
are <i>Ichthyornis</i> (= <i>Graculavus</i>) and <i>Hesperornis</i>, from the
Cretaceous shales of Kansas. They were placed by Marsh in a
distinct subclass of birds, <i>Odontornithes</i> (<i>q.v.</i>). Probably all
birds of Cretaceous age were still possessed of teeth. <i>Baptornis</i>,
another of Marsh&rsquo;s genera, seems to be allied to <i>Enaliornis</i>,
<i>Palaeotringa</i> and <i>Talmatornis</i>, were by him referred to Limicoline
and Passerine birds. <i>Laornis</i> from the Cretaceous marls of New
Jersey was as large as a swan.</p>

<p>The lower Eocene has furnished a greater number of bird
bones. Some of the largest are those of <i>Gastornis</i>, with three
species from France, Belgium and England. Much difference
of opinion obtains as to the affinities of these birds, which were
far larger than an ostrich; they were undoubtedly incapable
of flight and there are indications of teeth in the upper jaw.
Provisionally this genus has been grouped with the Ratitae,
which at any rate are a heterogenous assembly. Sir R. Owen&rsquo;s
<i>Dasornis</i>, of the London Clay, known from an imperfect cranium,
and E.D. Cope&rsquo;s <i>Diatryma</i> of New Mexico, based upon a gigantic
metatarsus, may also belong there. The London Clay of South
England has likewise supplied some long upper arm bones,
<i>Argillornis</i>. The most remarkable specimen is a skull, <i>Odontopteryx
toliapicus</i> (figs. 17, 18); the edges of the jaws were serrated
like those of certain tortoises. The character of this skull and
the compound rhamphotheca (known by the imprints left upon
the jaws) indicate affinities with the Steganopodes. Remnants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page971" id="page971"></a>971</span>
of a heron-like bird, <i>Proherodius</i>, of a gull-like creature, <i>Halcyornis</i>,
a raptorial <i>Lithornis</i>; and a supposed Passerine from Glarus in
Switzerland, called <i>Protornis = Osteornis</i>, complete the list.</p>

<p>The upper Eocene has yielded many birds, most of which are
at least close forerunners of recent genera, the differentiation
into the leading orders and families being already well marked,
<i>e.g.</i> Gallinaceous birds, stork- and crane-like waders, rails, birds
of prey, cormorants, &amp;c. Especially numerous bones have been
found in the Paris basin, chiefly described by G. Cuvier, F.L.P.
Gervais, E. Blanchard, and above all by A. Milne-Edwards, and
in the equivalent beds of Hampshire. Others have been discovered
in Wyoming; a giant penguin, <i>Palaecudyptes</i>, is known
from New Zealand, and <i>Palaeospheniscus</i> from Patagonia. The
Miocene has yielded by far the greatest number of bird-bones,
including even eggs and imprints of feathers. For instance,
from the lower Miocene beds of Allier and Puy-de-Dôme Milne-Edwards
has described about 50 species. Of these <i>Palaelodus</i>
was an ancestral flamingo, but with shorter legs; <i>Limnatornis</i>
is referred to the hoopoes. The existing genera include <i>Anas,
Aquila, Bubo, Columba, Cypselus, Lanius, Picus, Phalacrocorax,
Sula, &amp;c.</i> Very interesting is the fact that <i>Serpentarius, Psittacus</i>
and <i>Trogon</i> are amongst this list of birds, which are now restricted
to the tropics. A similarly mixed avifauna has been found in the
mid-Miocene beds of various other parts of France, Germany
and Italy. In Colorado and New Mexico Marsh has detected
bones of <i>Meleagris, Puffinus, Sula</i> and <i>Uria</i>, all existing genera;
but the first is especially suggestive, since it is one of the most
characteristic forms of the New World.</p>

<p>Here may be interpolated a short account of the very peculiar
avifauna found in the Tertiary strata of Santa Cruz in Patagonia.
Instead of the age of lower Eocene, as had been stated originally,
these beds are not older than mid-Miocene, and not a few of
the bones are of a much younger, even latest Tertiary date.
Discovered, and partly described, by F. Ameghino, the bones
have been sumptuously monographed by F.P. Moreno and
A. Mercerat, who proposed for them the name of <i>Stereornithes</i>,
a new order of birds, mostly gigantic in size, and said to combine
the characters of Anseres, Herodiones and Accipitres. But the
whole mass of bones is in hopeless disorder, apparently without
any record of association. At any rate, the &ldquo;<i>Stereornithes</i>,&rdquo;
accepted as such in Bronn&rsquo;s <i>Thierreich</i>, and in Newton&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary
of Birds</i>, had to be dissolved as an unnatural, haphazard assembly.
Many of these birds, to judge from the enormous size of their
hind-limbs, were undoubtedly flightless, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Brontornis</i>, and
remind us of the Eocene <i>Gastornis</i> of Europe. <i>Phororhacos</i>,
the most extraordinary of all, belongs to the Gruiformes, perhaps
also <i>Pelecyornis</i> and <i>Liornis</i>. On the other hand, the late
Tertiary <i>Dryornis</i> is a member of the Cathartae or American
vultures, and <i>Mesembriornis</i>, likewise of late Tertiary date, is
a close forerunner of the recent genus <i>Rhea</i>.</p>

<p>Pliocene remains are less numerous than those of the Miocene.
From Pikermi in Greece is known a <i>Gallus</i>, a <i>Phasianus</i> and a
large <i>Grus</i>. From Samos a large stork, <i>Amphipelargus</i>, and a
typical <i>Struthio</i>; from the Sivalik Hills on the southern flanks
of the Himalayas also an ostrich, and another Ratite with three
toes, <i>Hypselornis</i>, as well as <i>Leptoptilus, Pelecanus</i> and <i>Phalacrocorax</i>.
The fossil egg of a struthious bird, <i>Struthiolithus</i>, has
been found near Cherson, south Russia, and
in north China. The Suffolk Crag has yielded
the unmistakable bones of an albatross,
<i>Diomedea</i>.</p>

<p>Most Pleistocene birds are generically, even
specifically, identical with recent forms; some,
however, have become extinct, or they have
become exterminated by man. A great
number of birds&rsquo; bones have been found in caves, and among
them some bearing marks of human workmanship. In France we
have a large and extinct crane, <i>Grus primigenia</i>, but more interesting
are the numerous relics of two species, the concomitants
even now of the reindeer, which were abundant in that country
at the period when this beast flourished there, and have followed
it in its northward retreat. These are the snowy owl, <i>Nyctea
scandiaca</i>, and the willow-grouse, <i>Lagopus albus</i>. A gigantic
swan, <i>Cygnus falconeri</i>, is known from the Zebug cavern in Malta.
From caves of Minas Geraes in Brazil, O. Winge has determined at
least 126 species, of which nearly all still survive in the country.
Kitchen-middens of England, Ireland and Denmark reveal the
existence of the capercally, <i>Tetrao urogallus</i>, and of the great
auk or gare-fowl, <i>Alca impennis</i>; both species long since
vanished from those countries. In the fens of East Anglia have
been found two humeri, one of them immature, of a true <i>Pelecanus</i>,
a bird now no longer inhabiting middle Europe.</p>

<p>Until a very recent epoch there flourished in Madagascar
huge birds referable to the Ratitae, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Aepyornis maximus</i>,
which laid enormous eggs, and not unnaturally recalls the
mythical &ldquo;roc&rdquo; that figures so largely in Arabian tales. New
Zealand has also yielded many flightless birds, notably the
numerous species and genera of <i>Dinornithidae</i>, some of which
survived into the 19th century (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Moa</a></span>); <i>Pseudapteryx</i> allied
to the <i>Kiwi</i>; <i>Cnemiornis</i>, a big, flightless goose; <i>Aptornis</i> and
<i>Notornis</i>, flightless rails; and <i>Harpagornis</i>, a truly gigantic
bird of prey with tremendous wings and talons.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite impossible, in a survey of extinct birds, to
divide them into those which are <i>bona fide</i> fossil, sub-fossil,
recently extirpated and partially exterminated. Nor is it possible,
except in a few cases, to decide whether they have come to an
end through the agency of man or through so-called natural

<p>Mauritius is famous for the dodo, killed off by man; there was
also a curiously crested parrot, <i>Lophopsittacus</i> (fig. 19).
In the Mare aux Songes have been found the bones of another
parrot, of ducks, pigeons, rails, herons, geese and of a dwarf
darter, <i>Plotus nanus</i>, all sub-fossil, now extinct. Very interesting
is <i>Aphanapteryx</i> (fig. 20), a long-billed, flightless rail,

probably extinct. The Antilles tell a similar tale. The great
auk, once common on the British coasts, those of Denmark, the
east coast of North America, then restricted to those of Newfoundland,
Greenland and Iceland, has been killed by man, and
the same fate has overtaken the Labrador duck, the Phillip
Island parrot, <i>Nestor productus</i>, and the large cormorant of

<p class="pt2 center sc">C. Geographical Distribution</p>

<p>The study of the extinct organisms of any country leads to
a proper appreciation of its existing flora and fauna; while,
on the other hand, a due consideration of the plants and animals
which may predominate within its bounds cannot fail to throw
more or less light on the changes it has in the course of ages
undergone. That is to say, the distribution of forms in time is
a subject so much connected with the distribution of forms in
space, that the one can hardly be separated from the other.
Granting this is a general truth, it must yet be acknowledged
as a special fact, that in fossil birds we have as yet but scanty
means of arriving at any precise results which will justify bold
generalization in the matter of avine distribution. Remains
of extinct birds are, compared with those of other classes of
vertebrates, exceedingly scarce, and these have been found in
very few, widely separated countries. The great problems
involved in the study of geographical distribution must therefore
be based mainly upon the other classes, both vertebrate
and invertebrate, which, moreover, enjoy less great facilities of
locomotion than the birds.</p>

<p>Yet it so happens that the great zoogeographical regions
of the world, now more or less generally accepted, have been
based upon the distribution of birds. The whole subject was
properly introduced by Treviranus,<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> who in his large philosophical
work devotes considerable space to the &ldquo;geographical
distribution of animals.&rdquo; Next we have to mention F. Tiedemann,<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
the Heidelberg anatomist, who has been generally
ignored, although he surpassed many a recent zoogeographer
by the wide view he took of the problem; in fact he was the
first to connect distribution with environmental or bionomic
factors; <i>e.g</i>. the remark on p. 481 of his work that &ldquo;the
countries of the East Indian flora have no kinds of birds in
common with America which are vegetable feeders.&rdquo; L.K.
Schmarda<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> divided the land into twenty-one realms, characterizing
these mainly by their birds. P.L. Sclater<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a> was the first
to divide the world into a few great &ldquo;regions,&rdquo; the Palaearctic,
Ethiopian, Indian and Australian forming one group, the &ldquo;Old
World&rdquo; (<i>Palaeogaea</i>); and the Nearctic and Neotropical forming
a second, the New World (<i>Neogaea</i>). Birds being of all
animals most particularly adapted for extended and rapid
locomotion, it became necessary for him to eliminate from his
consideration those groups, be they small or large, which are
of more or less universal occurrence, and to ground his results
on what was at that time commonly known as the order
Insessores or Passeres, comprehending the orders now differentiated
as Passeriformes, Coraciiformes and Cuculiformes, in other
words the mass of arboreal birds. His six main
divisions&mdash;practically adopted by A.R. Wallace<a name="fa5j" id="fa5j" href="#ft5j"><span class="sp">5</span></a> in his epoch-making
work&mdash;are excellent, taken separately. They express the main
complexes of land with their dependencies in well-chosen terms;
for instance the &ldquo;Neotropical region&rdquo; stands short for South
and Central America with the Antilles.</p>

<p>But these six divisions of Sclater and Wallace are not all
equivalent, only some are of primary importance; they require
co- and sub-ordination. This most important advance was
made by T.H. Huxley.<a name="fa6j" id="fa6j" href="#ft6j"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Some of the &ldquo;regions&rdquo; have now to
be called subregions, <i>e.g</i>. the Nearctic and the Palaearctic.
The reduction of the Oriental to a subregion, with consequent
&ldquo;provincial&rdquo; rank of its main subdivisions, will probably be
objected to, but these are matters of taste and prejudice. Above
all it should be borne in mind that nearly all the last subdivisions
or provinces are of very little real value and most of them are
inapplicable to other classes of animals.</p>

<p>In the following account the characterization of the various
regions and subregions has to a very great extent been adopted
from Newton&rsquo;s article in his <i>Dictionary of Birds</i>, and from the
chapter on distribution in the article on &ldquo;Birds&rdquo; in the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, 9th edition. This applies especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page973" id="page973"></a>973</span>
to those instances in which the members of families, genera
and species are mentioned. The families are those which are
enumerated in Garow&rsquo;s classification. The numbers of genera
and species of birds are, of course, a matter of personal inclination.
If we take a moderate computation the number of recent species
may be taken at 10,000-11,000.<a name="fa7j" id="fa7j" href="#ft7j"><span class="sp">7</span></a> Dr R.B. Sharpe increases
their number to about 15,000 in the <i>New Hand-List of Birds</i>,
published by the British Museum. In the first two volumes
fossil birds, occasionally based upon a fragmentary bone only,
are also included.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(A) <span class="sc">Austrogaea</span>, the Australian region in the wider sense, with the
Papuan, Australian and New Zealand subregions, including also Polynesia.
We may here quote Newton (<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, 9th ed.,
&ldquo;Birds,&rdquo; p. 738) on the remarkable differences between this region
and the rest of the Old World:&mdash;&ldquo;The prevalent zoological features
of any Region are of two kinds&mdash;negative and positive. It is therefore
just as much the business of the zoogeographer, who wishes to
arrive at the truth, to ascertain what groups of animals are wanting
in any particular locality (altogether independently of its extent)
as to determine those which are forthcoming there. Of course, in
the former case it would be absurd to regard as a physical feature
of any great value the absence from a district of groups which do
not occur except in its immediate neighbourhood; but when we
find that certain groups, though abounding in some part of the
vicinity, either suddenly cease from appearing or appear only in very
reduced numbers, and occasionally in abnormal forms, the fact
obviously has an important bearing. Now, mere geographical considerations,
taken from the situation and configuration of the islands
of the so-called Indian or Malay Archipelago, would indicate that
they extended in an unbroken series from the shores of the Strait
of Malacca to the southern coast of New Guinea, which confronts
that of north Australia in Torres Strait, or even farther to the eastward.
Indeed, the very name Australasia, often applied to this part
of the world, would induce the belief that all the countless islands,
be they large or small&mdash;and some of them are among the largest
on the globe&mdash;were but a southern prolongation of the mainland of
Asia. But so far from this being the case a very definite barrier is
interposed. A strait, some 15 m. or so in width, and separating the
two fertile but otherwise insignificant islands of Bali and Lombok,
makes such a frontier as can hardly be shown to exist elsewhere.
The former of these two islands belongs to the Indian Region, the
latter to the Australian, and between them there is absolutely no
true transition&mdash;that is, no species are common to both which cannot
be easily accounted for by the various accidents and migrations that
in the course of time must have tended to mingle the productions
of islands so close to one another. The faunas of the two are as
absolutely distinct as those of South America and Africa, and it is
only because they are separated by a narrow strait instead of the
broad Atlantic that they have become so slightly connected by the
interchange of a few species and genera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, first, of the forms of birds which are prevalent throughout
the Indian Region, but are entirely wanting in the Australian, we
have at once the bulbuls (<i>Ixidae</i>), very characteristic of most parts
of Africa and Asia, including the sub-group <i>Phyllornithinae</i>, which
is peculiar to the Indian Region; the widely-spread families of
barbets (<i>Megalaeminae</i>) and vultures (<i>Vulturidae</i>); and the pheasants
(<i>Phasianidae</i>), which attain so great a development in various
parts of the Asiatic continent and islands that there must their home
be regarded as fixed. Some naturalists would add the finches
(<i>Fringillidae</i>), rightly if we assume that the <i>Ploceidae</i> or weavers
constitute a separate family. Then, of forms which are but weakly
represented, we have the otherwise abundant thrushes (<i>Turdidae</i>),
and, above all, the woodpeckers (<i>Picidae</i>), of which only very
few species, out of 400, just cross the boundary and occur in
Lombok, Celebes or the Moluccas, but are unknown elsewhere in the
region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Australian region is also remarkable for its ornithic
singularity. All the existing Ratitae (with the exception of the
ostriches of Africa and South America, belonging to the genera
<i>Struthio</i> and <i>Rhea</i>, and comprising at most but five species) are
found in Austrogaea and nowhere else. Of the Passeres the honey-suckers
(<i>Meliphagidae</i>) are most characteristic, and, abounding in
genera and species, extend to almost every part of the region, yet
only one species of <i>Ptilotis</i> oversteps its limits, crossing the sea from
Lombok to Bali. Other peculiar families are much more confined.
But the positive characteristics of the region as a whole are not its
peculiar forms alone; there are at least four families which, being
feebly represented elsewhere, here attain the maximum of development.
Such are the thick-headed shrikes (<i>Pachycephalidae</i>), the
caterpillar-eaters (<i>Campephagidae</i>), the flower-peckers (<i>Dicaeidae</i>),
and the swallow-flycatchers (<i>Artamidae</i>). Besides these, three or
perhaps four groups, though widely distributed throughout the
world, arrive in the Australian region at their culmination, presenting
an abundance of most varied forms. These are the weaver-birds
(<i>Ploceidae</i>), and the moreporks (<i>Podargidae</i>), but especially the
kingfishers (<i>Alcedinidae</i>) and the pigeons (<i>Columbidae</i>), the species
belonging to the two last obtaining in this region a degree of prominence
and beauty which is elsewhere unequalled.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the subregions are not well defined.</p>

<p>The <i>New Zealand Subregion</i>, considered by Professors Newton
and Huxley and various other zoogeographers as deserving the
rank of a region, is, and to all appearance has long been, more isolated
than any other portion of the globe. Besides the three larger islands
numerous satellites belong to the subregion, as Lord Howe, Norfolk
and Kermadec islands, with the Chatham, Auckland and Macquarie
groups. The main affinities of the avifauna are, of course, Australian.
The most extraordinary feature is unquestionably the former
existence of the gigantic Dinornithes or moas (<i>q.v.</i>) and, another
family of Ratitae, the weird-looking kiwis or Apteryges, which are
totally unlike any other existing birds. Of other peculiar genera it
will suffice to mention only the more remarkable. <i>Rallidae</i>
present the very noteworthy woodhens, <i>Ocydromus</i>, and the takahe,
<i>Notornis</i>, which is almost extinct. The widely-spread plovers,
<i>Charadriidae</i>, have two not less singular generic developments,
<i>Thinornis</i>, and the extraordinary wrybill, <i>Anarhynchus</i>. There is
an owl, type of the genus <i>Sceloglaux</i>. Of parrots, <i>Stringops</i>, the
kakapo or owl-parrot, is certainly peculiar, while <i>Nestor</i> constitutes
a peculiar subfamily of the brush-tongued parrots or <i>Trichoglossidae</i>.
<i>Xenicus</i> and <i>Acanthositta</i> form a little family of truly mesomyodean
Passeres Clamatores. Of the <i>Meliphagidae</i> the genera <i>Prosthemadera</i>,
<i>Pogonornis</i> and <i>Anthornis</i> are peculiar. The starlings,
<i>Sturnidae</i>, are represented by <i>Callaeas</i>, <i>Creadion</i> and the very
abnormal <i>Heterolocha</i>. The gallinaceous birds are represented by
a quail, <i>Coturnix novae zealandiae</i>, now exterminated. A large
flightless goose, <i>Cnemiornis</i>, allied to the Australian <i>Cereopsis</i>, and
the gigantic rapacious <i>Harpagornis</i>, have died out recently, with
the moas. In all, there is a wonderful amount of specialization,
though perhaps in a very straight line from generalized forms;
but the affinity to Australian or Polynesian types is in many cases
clearly traceable, and it cannot be supposed but that these last are
of cognate origin with those of New Zealand. A very long period
of isolation must have been required to produce the differences so
manifestly to be observed, but a few forms seem at rare intervals
to have immigrated, and this immigration would appear to be kept
up to our own day, as shown by the instance of <i>Zosterops lateralis</i>,
which is said to have lately made its first appearance, and to have
established itself in the country, as well as by the fact of two cuckoos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page974" id="page974"></a>974</span>
the widely-ranging <i>Eudynamis taitensis</i> and <i>Chrysococcyx lucidus</i>,
which are annual visitors.</p>

<p><i>Polynesia</i> forms, of course, part of Austrogaea. Its extent is so vast
that it necessarily contains some peculiar, outlying forms, so to say
forgotten, which in their long-continued isolation have specialized
themselves. For instance, the kagu (<i>Rhinochetus</i>) of New Caledonia, a
queerly specialized form with Gruine affinities pointing only to South
America. The toothbilled pigeon (<i>Didunculus</i>) is restricted to
Samoa. Most interesting is the avifauna of the Sandwich islands;
entirely devoid of Psittaci and of Coraciiformes, these islands show
an extraordinary development of its peculiar family <i>Drepanidae</i>,
which are probably of South or Central American descent. <i>Acrulocercus</i>
is a Meliphagine, and a peculiar genus. There are a raven
(<i>Corvus</i>), a coot (<i>Fulica</i>), the well-known Sandwich island goose
(<i>Bernicla sandvicensis</i>), now very commonly domesticated in Europe;
and some flycatchers and thrushlike birds.</p>

<p>The <i>Australian Subregion</i> comprises Australia and Tasmania. In
the north it is influenced, of course, by its proximity to Papuasia,
whence there is a considerable admixture of genera which do not
proceed beyond the tropics, and of these <i>Casuarius</i> is a striking
example. The Cape York peninsula practically belongs to Papuasia.
As a whole, Australia is rich in parrots, of which it has several very
peculiar forms, but Picarians in old-fashioned parlance, of all sorts&mdash;certain
kingfishers excepted&mdash;are few in number, and the pigeons
are also comparatively scarce, no doubt because of the many arboreal
predaceous marsupials. The continent, however, possesses the two
important genera of the <i>Pseudoscines</i>, namely the lyre-birds (<i>Menura</i>)
and the scrub-birds (<i>Atrichia</i>). Among the more curious forms of
other land-birds may be especially mentioned the <i>Megapodiidae</i>,
<i>Lipoa</i> and <i>Talegallus</i>, the rail <i>Tribonyx</i> and <i>Pedionomus</i>, which
represents the otherwise palaeotropical <i>Turnices</i> in Australia. The
presence of bustards (<i>Eupodotis</i>) is a curious example of interrupted
distribution, since none other of the <i>Otididae</i> are found nearer than
India. The Ratitae are represented by two species of emeu
(<i>Dromaeus</i>), besides the cassowary of Cape York peninsula, and the
extinct <i>Dromornis</i> and <i>Genyornis</i> with its enormous skull.</p>

<p>The <i>Papuan Subregion</i>, chiefly New Guinea with its dependencies,
the Timor group of islands, the Moluccas and Celebes. On
the whole its avifauna presents some very remarkable features.
Its most distinctive characteristic is the presence of the birds of
paradise, which are almost peculiar to it; for, granting that the
bower-birds, <i>Chlamydodera</i> and others, of Australia, belong to the
same family, they are far less highly specialized than the beautiful
and extraordinary forms which are found, within very restricted
limits, in the various islands of the subregion. Another chief feature
is the extraordinary development of the cassowaries, the richness
and specialization of the kingfishers, parrots, pigeons, honey-suckers
and some remarkable flycatchers. It has several marked deficiencies
compared with Australia, among which are the babblers (<i>Timeliidae</i>),
weaver birds (<i>Ploceidae</i>), the <i>Platycercinae</i> among parrots, diurnal
birds of prey and the emeus. As a whole, the birds of Papua are
remarkable for their brilliance of plumage, or their metallic colouring.
The birds of paradise, the racquet-tailed kingfishers, <i>Tanysiptera</i>,
the largest and smallest of parrots, <i>Calyptdrhynchiis</i> and
<i>Nasiterna</i>, and the great crowned pigeons, <i>Goura</i>, are very characteristic;
and so are the various Megapodes.</p>

<p>(B) <span class="sc">Neogaea</span>, or the <i>Neotropical region.</i>&mdash;Excepting towards the
north, where, in Mexico, it meets, and inosculates with the Nearctic
subregion, the boundaries of the Neotropical region are simple
enough to trace, comprehending as it does the whole of South
America and all Central America; besides including the Falkland
islands to the south-east and the Galapagos under the equator to
the west, as well as the Antilles or West India islands up to the
Florida channel.</p>

<p>Owing to the comparatively scanty number of harmful mammalian
types, the birds play a considerable part in this large region, and
some authorities consider its avifauna the richest in the world.
The entire number of species amounts to about 3600. Of these
2000, or a good deal more than half, belong to the order Passeriformes.
But the characteristic nature of the avifauna is more clearly brought
out when we learn that of the 2000 species just mentioned only
about 1070 belong to the higher suborder of Oscines, that means
to say, nearly one-half belong to the lower suborder Clamatores.
This is a state of things which exists nowhere else; for except in
Australia, where a few indigenous and peculiar low non-Oscines are
found, and in the Nearctic country, whither one family of Clamatores,
viz. the <i>Tyrannidae</i>, has evidently been led by the geographical
continuity of its soil with that of the Neotropical region, such forms
do not occur elsewhere. Accordingly their disproportionate prevalence
in South America points unerringly to the lower rank of the
avifauna of the region as a whole, and therefore to the propriety
of putting it next in order to that of the Australian region, the
general fauna of which is admittedly the lowest in the world. Huxley
has urged with his wonted perspicuity the alliance of these two
regions as <i>Notogaea</i>, basing his opinion, besides other weighty
evidence, in great measure on the evidence afforded by the two main
sections of the Galli, viz. the <i>Peristeropodes</i> and the <i>Alectoropodes</i>,
the former composed of the families <i>Megapodiidae</i>, almost wholly
Australian, and the <i>Cracidae</i>, entirely Neotropical. (Cf. <i>P.Z.S.</i>,
1868. pp. 294-319.)</p>

<p>Leaving, however, this matter as in some degree hypothetical,
we have as genera, families, or perhaps even larger groups, a great
many very remarkable forms which are characteristic of, or peculiar
to, the Neotropical region in part, if not as a whole. Of families
we find twenty-three, or maybe more, absolutely restricted thereto,
besides at least eight which, being peculiar to the New World,
extend their range into the Nearctic region, but are there so feebly
developed that their origin may be safely ascribed to the southern
portion of America. First in point of importance comes the extraordinarily
beautiful family of humming-birds (<i>Trochilidae</i>), with
nearly 150 genera (of which only three occur in the Nearctic region)
and more than 400 species. Then the tyrants (<i>Tyrannidae</i>), with
more than seventy genera (ten of which range into the northern
region), and over 300 species. To these follow the tanagers (<i>Tanagndae</i>),
with upwards of forty genera (only one of which crosses the
border), and about 300 species; the piculules (<i>Dendrocolaptidae</i>),
with as many genera, and over 200 species; the ant-thrushes,
(<i>Formicariidae</i>), with more than thirty genera, and nearly 200 species;
together with other groups which, if not so large as those just
named, are yet just as well defined, and possibly more significant,
namely, the tapaculos (<i>Pteroptochidae</i>), the toucans (<i>Rhamphastidae</i>),
the jacamars (<i>Galbulidae</i>), the motmots (<i>Monotidae</i>), the todies
(<i>Todidae</i>), the trumpeters (<i>Psophiidae</i>), and the screamers (<i>Palamedeidae</i>);
besides such isolated forms as the seriema (<i>Cariama</i>),
and the sun-bittern (<i>Eurypyga</i>).</p>

<p>The nature of the South American avifauna will perhaps become
still more evident if we arrange the characteristic members as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Birds which are restricted to, probably indigenous of the
region: <i>Rhea</i>; <i>Palamedea</i> and <i>Chauna</i>, the screamers; <i>Tinami</i>;
<i>Psophia, Dicholophus, Eurypyga, Heliornis</i> of the Gruiform assembly;
<i>Thinocorys</i> and <i>Attagis; Cracidae; Opisthocomus</i>; of parrots <i>Ara</i>
and <i>Conurus</i> with their allies; <i>Monotidae</i>, incl. <i>Todus; Steatornis;
Galbulinae</i> and <i>Bucconinae; Rhamphastidae; Formicariidae, Pteroptochidae</i>,
and of the <i>Tyrannidae</i> the <i>Cotinginae</i>.</p>

<p>2. Birds which are indigenous, but extend far into North America:
<i>Cathartae, Trochilidae, Tyrannidae</i>.</p>

<p>3. Birds which are originally immigrants from North America:
<i>Podicipedidae</i>, with the flightless <i>Centropelma</i> on Lake Titicaca;
<i>Ceryle</i>, the only genus of kingfishers in the New World; all the
<i>Oscines</i>.</p>

<p>More or less cosmopolitan groups like herons, <i>Falconidae, Anseres,
Columbae, &amp;c.</i>, and circumtropical families like <i>Parridae, Trogonidae,
Capitonidae</i>, are to be excluded from these lists as indifferent. The
differences between the Neotropical avifauna and that of North
America are fundamental and prove the independence or superior
value of the Neotropical region as one of the principal realms.</p>

<p>It is difficult to subdivide the Neotropical region into subregions;
the best suggestion is that of Newton: <i>Antillean</i>, with
the exception of the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, as well as those
which lie on the northern coast of South America; <i>Patagonian</i>,
including Chile and part of Peru; <i>Columbian</i>, comprising the rest
of the continent and also Central America.</p>

<p>The <i>Antillean Subregion</i> is in many respects one of the most
suggestive and interesting, comparatively small though it be. For
narrow as are the channels between Cuba and the opposite coast of
Central America, between the Bahamas and Florida, and between
Grenada and Tobago, the fauna of the Antillean chain, instead of
being a mixture of that of the almost contiguous countries, differs
much from all, and exhibits in some groups a degree of speciality
which may be not unfitly compared with that of oceanic islands.
Except such as are of coral formation, the Antilles are hilly, not to
say mountainous, their summits rising in places to an elevation of
8000 ft., and nearly all, prior to their occupation by Europeans,
were covered with luxuriant forest, which, assisting in the collection
and condensation of the clouds brought by the trade winds, ensured
its own vitality by precipitating frequent and long-continued rains
upon the fertile soil. Under such conditions we might expect to
find an extremely plentiful animal population, one as rich as that
which inhabits the same latitudes in Central America, not many
degrees farther to the west; but no instance perhaps can be cited
which shows more strikingly the difference between a continental
and an insular fauna, since, making every allowance for the ravages
of cultivation by civilized man, the contrary is the case, and possibly
no area of land so highly favoured by nature is so poorly furnished
with the higher forms of animal life. Here, as over so large a portion
of the Australian region, we find birds constituting the supreme
class&mdash;the scarcity of mammals being accounted for in some measure
as a normal effect of insularity.</p>

<p>There is one peculiar subfamily, <i>Todinae</i>, represented by only four
species of <i>Todus</i>. We note the absence of <i>Ratitae, Tinami, Cracidae,
Rhamphastidae</i>, and any of those gruiform genera which are so
characteristic of the continent. There is no family of birds common
to the Nearctic area and the Antillean subregion without occurring
also in other parts of the Neotropical region, a fact which proves its
affinity to the latter.</p>

<p>The <i>Patagonian Subregion</i>, most extratropical, is naturally
devoid of a good many typically tropical birds, or these are but
poorly represented, for instance <i>Caerebidae, Mniotiltidae, Tanagridae,
Vireonidae</i>. On the other hand some of the most characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page975" id="page975"></a>975</span>
features of the whole region are here well represented, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Rhea,
Tinami, Chauna, Dicholophus, Attagis, Pteroptochidae</i>, and indeed
therein we find some of the best evidence of the antiquity of its
population, both recent and extinct (cf. the numerous fossils of the
Santa Cruz formation), and also the nearest resemblance to the fauna
of Austrogaea.</p>

<p>(C) <span class="sc">Arctogaea</span> is Huxley&rsquo;s well-chosen term for all the rest of
the world (including the Nearctic, Palaearctic, Indian and Ethiopian
regions of P.L. Sclater) in opposition to Notogaea. Faunistically,
although not geographically, the Nearctic and Palaearctic areas
must form the two subdivisions of one great unit, for which the
&ldquo;Holarctic region&rdquo; is now the generally accepted term.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Holarctic Region</span>, comprising North America and the extratropical
mass of land of the Old World, may from an ornithological
point of view be characterized by the Colymbi, <i>Alcidae, Gallidae</i> or
Alectoropodous Galli, and the Oscines, which have here reached
their highest development; while Ratitae, Tinami, Psittaci, and
non-Oscine Passeres (with the exception of <i>Tyrannidae</i> extending
into North America and <i>Conurus carolinensis</i>) are absent.</p>

<p><i>Nearctic Subregion.</i>&mdash;The close affinity of North America with
the Palaearctic avifauna becomes at once apparent if we exclude
those groups of birds which we have good reason to believe have
their original home in the Neotropical region, notably numerous
<i>Tyrannidae</i>, humming-birds and the turkey-buzzards.</p>

<p>The following groups may be mentioned as characteristic and
typically American, and, since we consider them as comparatively
recent immigrants into the Neotropical region, as originally peculiar
to the Nearctic area: <i>Mniotiltidae, Vireonidae, Icteridae, Meleagris</i>
and various <i>Tetraoninae</i>. Restricted to and peculiar to the sub-region
is only the little Oscine family of <i>Chamaeidae</i>, restricted to
the coast district of California. &ldquo;More than one-third of the genera
of Nearctic birds are common also to the Palaearctic subregion. If
we take the number of Nearctic species at 700, which is perhaps an
exaggeration, and that of the Palaearctic at 850, we find that,
exclusive stragglers, there are about 120 common to the two areas.
Nearly 20 more are properly Palaearctic, but occasionally occur in
America, and about 50 are Nearctic, which from time to time stray
to Europe or Asia. This, however, is by no means the only point of
resemblance. Of many genera, the so-called species found in the
New World are represented in the Old by forms so like them that
often none but an expert can distinguish them, and of such representative
&lsquo;species&rsquo; about 80 might be enumerated&rdquo; (Newton, <i>Dict.
Birds</i>, p. 335).</p>

<p>Of the many attempts to subdivide the Nearctic subregion, the
same authority favours that of Dr S.F. Baird, who distinguishes
between <i>Canadian, Alleghanian, Middle</i> or Missourian, <i>Californian</i>
and <i>Alaskan</i> provinces. Dr Hart Merriam takes the broad point
of view &ldquo;that the whole of extratropical North America consists of
but two primary life regions, a <i>Boreal</i> region, which is circumpolar,
and a <i>Sonoran</i> or Mexican tableland region which is unique.&rdquo; The
first of these supports Newton&rsquo;s contention of the essential unity of
the Nearctic and Palaearctic areas. In any case the various Nearctic
subdivisions completely merge into each other, just as is to be
expected from the physical configuration and other bionomic
conditions of the Nort American continent.</p>

<p>The <i>Palaearctic Subregion</i> is, broadly speaking, Europe and Asia,
with the exception of India and China. The propriety of comprehending
this enormous tract in one zoological &ldquo;region&rdquo; was
first shown by Dr P.L. Sclater, and as regards the distribution of
most classes of animals there have been few to doubt that it is an
extremely natural one. Not indeed altogether so homogeneous as
the Nearctic area, it presents, however, even at its extreme points,
no very striking difference between the bulk of its birds. Though
Japan is far removed from western Europe, and though a few generic
forms and still fewer families inhabit the one without also frequenting
the other, yet there is a most astonishing similarity in a large portion
of their respective birds. In some cases the closest examination has
failed to detect any distinction that may be called specific between
the members of their avifauna; but in most it is possible to discover
just sufficient difference to warrant a separation of the subjects.
Nevertheless, it is clear that in Japan we have, as it were, a repetition
of some of our most familiar species&mdash;the redbreast and the hedge-sparrow,
for example&mdash;slightly modified in plumage or otherwise, so
as to furnish instances of the most accurate representation, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Cyanopica cooki</i> of Portugal and Spain, and <i>C. cyana</i> of Amoorland
and Japan.</p>

<p>Like the Nearctic the Palaearctic subregion seems to possess but
one single peculiar family of land birds, the <i>Panuridae</i>, represented
by the beautiful species known to Englishmen as the bearded tit-mouse,
<i>Panurus biarmicus</i>. The entire number of Palaearctic
families are, according to Newton, 67, and of the genera 323. Of
these 128 are common to the Nearctic subregion. Species of 51
more seem to occur as true natives within the Ethiopian and Indian
regions, and besides these 18 appear to be common to the Ethiopian
without being found in the Indian, and no fewer than 71 to the
Indian without occurring in the Ethiopian. To compare the Palaearctic
genera with those of the Australian and Neotropical regions
would be simply a waste of time, for the points of resemblance are
extremely few, and such as they are they lead to nothing. It will
therefore be seen from the above that next to the Nearctic are the
Palaearctic has a much greater affinity to any other, a fact which
might be expected from geographical considerations.</p>

<p>Having shown this much we have next to deal with the peculiarities
of the vast Palaearctic subregion. At the lowest computation 37
genera seem to be peculiar to it, though it is certain that species
of several are regularly wont to wander beyond its limits in winter
seeking a southern climate. Of the peculiar genera only a few
examples may be mentioned: <i>Eurynorhynchus</i>, the spoon-billed
sandpiper of Siberia; <i>Syrrhaptes</i>, the sandgrouse of central Asia;
<i>Musicicapa</i> of Europe.</p>

<p>We distinguish between a <i>Siberian, Mongolian, Mediterranean</i>
and <i>European province</i>, none of which can be well defined. The
islands of the Canaries, Madeira and the Azores belong to the Mediterranean
province, and offer some peculiarities of great interest.
The Azores have been monographed by F.D. Godman (<i>Nat. Hist. of
the Azores or Western Islands</i>, London, 1870). There is a general
tendency among these insular birds to vary more or less from their
continental representatives, and this is especially shown by the
former having always darker plumage and stronger bills and legs.
In one instance the variation is so excessive that it fully justifies
the establishment of a specific distinction. This is the case of the
bullfinch of the more western of these islands (<i>Pyrrhula murina</i>),
the male of which, instead of the ruddy breast of its well-known
congener (<i>P. vulgaris</i>), has that part of a sober mouse-colour. A
similar sombre hue distinguishes the peculiar chaffinch of the Canary
Islands (<i>Fringilla teydea</i>), but to these islands as well as the Azores
and Madeiras there belongs in common another chaffinch (<i>F. tintillon</i>)
which, though very nearly allied to that of Mauritania (<i>F. spodogenia</i>)
is perfectly recognizable, and not found elsewhere. Madeira has also
its peculiar golden-crested wren (<i>Regulus maderensis</i>), and its peculiar
pigeon (<i>Columba trocaz</i>), while two allied forms of the latter (<i>C.
laurivora</i> and <i>C. bollii</i>) are found only in the Canaries. Further on
this subject we must not go; we can only state that Godman has
shown good reason for declaring that the avifauna of all these islands
is the effect of colonization extending over a long period of years, and
going on now.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Palaeotropical Region</span>.&mdash;Much can be said in favour of combining
the mostly tropical portion of the great mass of land of the Old
World (excluding, of course, Austrogaea or the Australian region)
into one region, for which Oscar Drude&rsquo;s well-chosen term &ldquo;palaeotropical&rdquo;
has been adopted (cf. Bronn&rsquo;s <i>Thierreich, System Part.</i>
p. 296, 1893). This region naturally comprises the African and
Indian areas, conformably to be called subregions.</p>

<p>Both subregions possess, besides others, the following characteristic
birds: Ratitae, viz. <i>Struthio</i> in Africa and Arabia, fossil also
in the Sivalik Hills, and <i>Aepyornithidae</i> in Madagascar; <i>Pittidae,
Bucerotinae</i> and <i>Upupinae</i>, of which <i>Upupa</i> itself in India, Madagascar
and Africa; <i>Coraciidae; Pycnonotidae</i> or bulbuls; <i>Trogonidae</i>,
of which the Asiatic genera are the less specialized in opposition to
the Neotropical forms; <i>Vulturidae; Leptoptilus, Anastomus</i> and
<i>Ciconia</i> among the storks; <i>Pteroclidae; Treroninae</i> among pigeons.
Of other families which, however, extend their range more or less
far into the Australian realm, may be mentioned <i>Otididae</i>, the
bustards; <i>Meropidae</i> or bee-eaters; <i>Muscicapidae</i> or flycatchers;
<i>Sturnidae</i> or starlings.</p>

<p>The <i>Ethiopian Subregion</i> comprises the whole of Africa and
Madagascar, except the Barbary States, but including Arabia; in
the north-east the subregion melts into the Palaearctic between
its limits still farther to the eastwards, through Beluchistan and even
beyond the Indus.</p>

<p>So large a portion of the Ethiopian subregion lies between the
tropics that no surprise need be expressed at the richness of its fauna
relatively to that of the last two subregions we have considered.
Between fifty and sixty so-called families of land birds alone are
found within its limits, and of them at least nine are peculiar; the
typical genera of which are <i>Buphaga, Euryceros, Philepitta, Musophaga,
Irrisor, Leptosoma, Colius, Serpentarius, Struthio, Aepyornis</i>.
It is singular that only the first three of them belong to the order
<i>Passeriformes</i>, a proportion which is not maintained in any other
tropical region. The number of peculiar genera, besides those just
mentioned, is too great for them to be named here; some of the
most remarkable on the continent are: <i>Balaeniceps</i>, the whale-headed
heron; <i>Balaearica</i>, the crowned crane; <i>Podica</i>, finfoot;
<i>Numida</i> and allied genera of guinea fowls.</p>

<p>The natural division of the subregion is that into an African and a
Madagascar province. Subdivision of the continental portion is
beset with great difficulties, and none of the numerous attempts
have proved long-lived. The forest-clad basin of the Congo, with
the coastal districts of the bay of Guinea, seem to form one domain
in opposition to the rest.</p>

<p>The Malagasy province comprises, besides Madagascar, the
Mascarene, Comoro and Seyehelle islands. It may be safely deemed
the most peculiar area of the earth&rsquo;s surface, while from the richness
and multifariousness of its animal, and especially of its ornithic
population, New Zealand cannot be compared with it. In A.
Grandidier&rsquo;s magnificent <i>Histoire physique, naturelle et politique de
Madagascar</i>, vol. xii. (Paris, 1875-1884), are enumerated 238 species
as belonging to the island, of which 129 are peculiar to it, and
among those are no fewer than 35 peculiar genera. <i>Euryceros</i> of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page976" id="page976"></a>976</span>
Oscines, and <i>Philepitta</i> of the Clamatores, are remarkable enough to
form the types of Passeriform families, and <i>Mesites</i> half-way between
Galli and Gruiformes is of prime importance. The Passerine
<i>Falculia</i>, with its recently extinguished allies <i>Fregilupus</i> and
<i>Necropsar</i> of the Mascarenes; the Coraciine <i>Brachypteracias</i>, <i>Atelornis</i>
and <i>Geobiastes</i>, are very abundant, while <i>Heliodilus</i> is an owl
belonging to that subfamily which is otherwise represented only by
the widely-spread barn owl, <i>Strix flammea</i>. Lastly must be noted
the extinct tall Ratite species of <i>Aepyornis</i> with its several fancy
genera. But, as Newton charmingly puts it (<i>Dict Birds</i>, p. 353), the
avifauna of Madagascar is not entirely composed of such singularities
as these. We have homely genera, even among the true <i>Passeres</i>,
occurring there&mdash;such as <i>Alauda, Acrocephalus, Motacilla</i> and
<i>Pratincola</i>, while the <i>Cisticola madagascariensis</i> is only distinguishable
from the well-known fan-tailed warbler, <i>C. schoenicola</i> of
Europe, Africa and India by its rather darker coloration. But there
are also species, though not Passerine, which are absolutely identical
with those of Britain, the barn owl, common quail, pigmy rail, and
little grebe or dabchick, all of them common and apparently resident
in the island. Mauritius had the dodo (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>Lophopsittacus</i> and
<i>Aphanapteryx</i>. Rodriguez had the solitaire, <i>Necropsittacus</i> and
<i>Necropsar</i>. Bourbon or Réunion had <i>Fregilupus</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the Malagasy avifauna is certainly ancient, aboriginal,
and even points to India; other forms indicate clearly their African
origin; while, lastly, such strikingly characteristic Indo-African
birds as hornbills are unaccountably absent.</p>

<p>The <i>Oriental Subregion</i> comprises all the countries and numerous
islands between the Palaearctic and Australian areas; it possesses
upwards of seventy families, of which, however, only one is peculiar,
but this family, the <i>Eurylaemidae</i> or broadbills, is of great importance
since it represents all the <i>Subclamatores</i>. Of the many characteristic
birds may be mentioned <i>Pycnonotidae</i> or bulbuls, of which the
<i>Phyllornithinae</i> are peculiar, <i>Campephagidae</i> or cuckoo shrikes,
<i>Dicruridae</i> or drongos, <i>Nectariniidae</i> or sunbirds; pheasants,
together with <i>Pavo</i> and <i>Gallus</i>. Some of the similarities to the
Ethiopian and the great differences from the Australian avifauna
have already been pointed out. Naturally no line whatever can be
drawn between the Oriental and the Palaearctic subregions, and
many otherwise essentially Indo-Malayan families extend far into
the Australian realm, far across Wallace&rsquo;s line, whilst the reverse
takes place to a much more moderate extent. Certainly the Oriental
area, in spite of its considerable size, cannot possibly claim the
standing of a primary region. It is a continuation of the great
Arctogaea into the tropics.</p>

<p>Following H.J. Elwes we subdivide the whole subregion into
a Himalo-Chinese, Indian and Malayan province. These divisions
had the approval of W.T. Blanford, who proposed the terms Cis-
and Trans-gangetic for the two first. The Himalo-Chinese or Trans-gangetic
province shows the characteristics of its avifauna also far
away to the eastward in Formosa, Hainan and Cochin China, and
again in a lesser degree to the southward in the mountains of Malacca
and Sumatra. Indo-China is especially rich in <i>Eurylaemidae</i>,
China proper and the Himalayas in pheasants.</p>

<p>The Indian or Cisgangetic province is the least rich of the three
so far as peculiar genera are concerned.</p>

<p>The Malayan province comprising the Malay islands, besides the
Malay peninsula, and the very remarkable Philippines, possess an
extraordinary number of peculiar and interesting genera.</p>

<p>The influence of the Australian realm is indicated by a Megapode
in Celebes, another in Borneo and Labuan, and a third in the Nicobar
islands (which, however, like the Andamans, belong to the Indian
province), but there are no cockatoos, these keeping strictly to the
other side of Wallace&rsquo;s line, whence we started on this survey of the
world&rsquo;s avifauna.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">D. Classification of Birds</p>

<p>Fürbringer&rsquo;s great work, published in the year 1888 by the
<i>Natura Artis Magistra</i> Society of Amsterdam, enabled Gadow
not only to continue for the next five years the same lines of
morphological research, but also further to investigate those
questions which were still left in abeyance or seemed to require
renewed study. The resulting &ldquo;classification is based on the
examination, mostly autoptic, of a far greater number of
characters than any that had preceded it; moreover, they were
chosen in a different way, discernment being exercised in sifting
and weighing them, so as to determine, so far as possible, the
relative value of each, according as that value may vary in
different groups, and not to produce a mere mechanical &lsquo;key&rsquo;
after the fashion become of late years so common&rdquo; (Newton&rsquo;s
<i>Dictionary of Birds</i>, Introduction, p. 103). It is not the quantity
but the quality of the anatomical and bionomic characters which
determines their taxonomic value, and a few fundamental
characters are better indications of the affinities of given groups
of birds than a great number of agreements if these can be
shown to be cases of isomorphism or heterophyletic, convergent
analogy. Nature possesses three great educational or developmental
schools&mdash;terrestrial, aquatic and aerial life. Each of
these affords animal, vegetable or mixed diet. Animal diet
implies the greatest variety with regard to locality and the modes
of procuring the food. Each of these schools impresses its pupils,
in the case of the birds, with its own stamp, but there are many
combinations, since in the course of phyletic development many
a group of birds has exchanged one school for another. Originally
terrestrial groups have taken to an entirely aquatic life, and
<i>vice versâ</i>; others, originally endowed with the power of flight,
have become, or are transforming themselves into, absolutely
cursorial forms; some members of one group live entirely on
seeds, while others have become fierce fishers, and so forth.
Only by the most careful inquiry into their history can their
relationship or pedigree be unravelled. A statement may now
be given of Gadow&rsquo;s classification of birds, in which the extinct
forms have been intercalated so far as possible. The few characters
assigned to the various groups are sufficiently diagnostic
when taken together, although they are not always those upon
which the classification has been established:&mdash;</p>

<p>The fourteen orders of the Carinatae are further congregated into
four &ldquo;Legions&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="list">
<p>&emsp;I. COLYMBOMORPHAE = <b>Ichthyornithes</b> + <b>Colymbiformes</b> +
<b>Sphenisciformes</b> + <b>Procellariiformes.</b></p>

<p>&ensp;II. PELARGOMORPHAE = <b>Ciconiiformes</b> + <b>Anseriformes</b> +
<b>Falconiformes.</b></p>

<p>III. ALECTOROMORPHAE = <b>Tinamiformes</b> + <b>Galliformes</b> +
<b>Gruiformes</b> + <b>Charadriiformes.</b></p>

<p>IV. CORACIOMORPHAE = <b>Cuculiformes</b> + <b>Coraciiformes</b> +
<b>Passeriformes.</b></p>
</div>

<p>These four legions are again combined into two &ldquo;Brigades,&rdquo; the
first of which comprises the first and second legions, while the
second brigade contains the third and fourth legions.</p>

<p>Thus the whole classification becomes a rounded-off phylogenetic
system, which, at least in its broad outlines, seems to approach the
natural system, the ideal goal of the scientific ornithologist. The
main branches of the resultant &ldquo;tree&rdquo; may be rendered as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:600px; height:119px" src="images/img978.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"></td></tr></table>

<p>The Odontolcae seem to be an early specialized offshoot of the
Colymbo Pelargomorphous brigade, while the Ratitae represent a
number of side branches of early Alectoromorphae. The Ratitae
branched off, probably during the Eocene period, from that still
indifferent stock which gave rise to the Tinami + Galli + Gruiformes,
when the members of this stock were still in possession of those
archaic characters which distinguish Ratitae from Carinatae. It
follows that new groups of Ratitae can no longer be developed since
there are no Carinatae living which still retain so many low characters,
<i>e.g.</i> configuration of the palate, precoracoid, pelvis, intestinal
convolutions, copulatory organ, &amp;c. Loss of the keel is co-ordinated
with the power of using the forelimbs for locomotion; although a
&ldquo;Ratite&rdquo; character, it is not sufficient to turn a <i>Notornis, Cnemiornis</i>
or <i>Stringops</i>, not even a <i>Phororhacos</i> into a member of the Ratitae.</p>

<p>Another branch of the Alectoromorphae, in particular of the
Galliformes, when these were still scarcely separated from the
Gruiformes, especially rail-like birds, leads through Opisthocomi
to the Cuculiformes. These are, again in an ascending direction,
connected with the Coraciiformes, out of which have arisen the
Passeriformes, and these have blossomed into the Oscines, which,
as the apotheosis of bird life, have conquered the whole inhabitable
world.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIRD-LOUSE,<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> any small flat degenerate wingless neuropterous
insect of the group Mallophaga, parasitic upon birds and
mammals and feeding upon dermal excretions or upon the softer
parts of hair and feathers. The term &ldquo;biting-lice&rdquo; is sometimes
given to these parasites, in allusion to the mandibulate character
of their mouth-parts, which serves to distinguish them at once
from the true lice of the order Rhynchota in which the jaws are
haustellate.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIRD&rsquo;S-EYE,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> a name applied to various small bright flowers,
especially those which have a small spot or &ldquo;eye&rdquo; in the centre.
The primula is thus spoken of, on account of its yellow centre,
also the adonis, or &ldquo;pheasant&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo; and the blue veronica,
or germander speedwell. The word is also applied to a sort of
tobacco, in which the stalks (of a mottled colour) are cut up
together with the leaves. From a similar sense comes the
phrase &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye maple,&rdquo; a speckled variety of maple-wood,
or the &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye handkerchief&rdquo; mentioned in Thackeray&rsquo;s
novels.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIRDSNESTING,<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> a general term for the pursuit of collecting
and preserving birds&rsquo; eggs, with or without the nests themselves.
The nests and eggs of wild birds are nowadays protected by
local laws almost everywhere in both Great Britain and the
United States. By law they may be taken for scientific purposes
only, by special licence. In order not to interfere seriously with
breeding it is customary to take but one egg from a nest, and,
if the nest itself be taken, to wait until the young birds have left
it. Every egg, unless &ldquo;hard-set,&rdquo; should be blown as soon as
removed from the nest. This is done by opening a small hole
in its side by means of a drill with a conical head, manufactured
for the purpose, a minute hole for the insertion of the drill-head
having first been made in the shell with a needle, which is then
used to stir up the contents, so that they shall flow easily. A
blow-pipe with a curved mouth is then inserted, the egg is held
hole downwards, and the contents blown out. The old-fashioned
method of making two holes in the egg is thus superseded.
Should the egg be &ldquo;hard-set&rdquo; a somewhat larger hole is made
and its edges reinforced with layers of paper pasted round them.
Minute forceps are then introduced and the embryo cut into
pieces small enough to pass through the hole. The inside of the
egg is then rinsed out with clean water, and also before being
placed in the cabinet, with a solution of corrosive sublimate,
which prevents decay and consequent discoloration of the inner
membrane. Finally the egg is placed with the hole downwards
upon a sheet of white blotting-paper to dry. The authentication
of the eggs is the most important duty of an egg-collector, next
to identifying the specimens. According to some the best
method is to mark with a fine pen on the egg itself the variety,
scientific name, locality of nest, date of taking and the initials
of the collector, as well as a reference to his note-book or catalogue.
Others advocate keeping the authentication separate
with only a numbered reference on the egg itself. Eggs should
not be transported in bran or sawdust, but in strong wool-lined
boxes. The best cabinets are fitted with drawers, pulled out to
inspect the eggs, but at other times closed to preserve them
from the light, which is injurious to their delicate colouring.
When an entire nest is taken it should be disinfected with hyposulphite
of soda or insect-powder.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRDS OF PARADISE,<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> a group of passerine birds inhabiting
New Guinea and the adjacent islands, so named by the Dutch
voyagers in allusion to the brilliancy of their plumage, and to
the current belief that, possessing neither wings nor feet, they
passed their lives in the air, sustained on their ample plumes, resting
only at long intervals suspended from the branches of lofty
trees by the wire-like feathers of the tail, and drawing their
food &ldquo;from the dews of heaven and the nectar of flowers.&rdquo;
Such stories obtained credence from the fact that so late as the
year 1760, when Linnaeus named the principal species <i>apoda</i>,
or &ldquo;footless,&rdquo; no perfect specimen had been seen in Europe, the
natives who sold the skins to coast traders invariably depriving
them of feet and wings. The birds now usually included under this
name belong to the family <i>Paradiseidae</i>, closely allied to the crows.
The largest is the great emerald bird (<i>Paradisea apoda</i>), about the
size of the common jay. Its head and neck are covered with
short thick-set feathers, resembling velvet pile, of a bright straw
colour above, and a brilliant emerald green beneath. From
under the shoulders on each side springs a dense tuft of golden-orange
plumes, about 2 ft. in length, which the bird can raise
at pleasure, so as to enclose the greater part of its body. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page979" id="page979"></a>979</span>
two centre tail feathers attain a length of 34 in., and, being destitute
of webs, have a thin wire-like appearance. This splendid
plumage, however, belongs only to the adult males, the females
being exceedingly plain birds of a nearly uniform dusky brown
colour, and possessing neither plumes nor lengthened tail feathers.
The young males at first resemble the females, and it is only
after the fourth moulting, according to A.R. Wallace, who has
studied those birds in their native haunts, that they assume
the perfect plumage of their sex, which, however, they retain
permanently afterwards, and not during the breeding season
only as was formerly supposed. At that season the males
assemble, in numbers varying from twelve to twenty, on certain
trees, and there disport themselves, so as to display their magnificent
plumes in presence of the females. Wallace in his
<i>Malay Archipelago</i>, vol. ii., thus describes the attitude of the
male birds at one of those &ldquo;sacaleli,&rdquo; or dancing parties, as the
natives call them; &ldquo;their wings,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are raised vertically
over the back, the head is bent down and stretched out, and the
long plumes are raised up and expanded till they form two
magnificent golden fans striped with deep red at the base, and
fading off into the pale brown tint of the finely-divided and
softly-waving points; the whole bird is then overshadowed
by them, the crouching body, yellow head, and emerald green
throat, forming
but the foundation
and setting to
the golden glory
which waves
above.&rdquo; It is at
this season that
those birds are
chiefly captured.
The bird-catcher
having found a
tree thus selected
for a &ldquo;dancing
party,&rdquo; builds a
hut among the
lower branches in
which to conceal
himself. As soon
as the male birds
have begun their
graceful antics,
he shoots them,
one after the other, with blunt arrows, for the purpose of stunning
and bringing them to the ground without drawing blood, which
would injure their plumage; and so eager are those birds in their
courtship that almost all the males are thus brought down
before the danger is perceived. The natives in preparing the
skins remove both feet and wings, so as to give more prominence
to the commercially valuable tuft of plumes. They also remove
the skull, and the skin is then dried in a smoky hut. The great
emerald bird, so far as yet known, is only found in the Aru
Islands. The lesser bird of paradise (<i>Paradisea minor</i>), though
smaller in size and somewhat less brilliant in plumage, in other
respects closely resembles the preceding species. It is also
more common, and much more widely distributed, being found
throughout New Guinea and the neighbouring islands. Its
plumes are those most generally used as ornaments for ladies&rsquo;
head-dresses. Both species are omnivorous, feeding voraciously
on fruits and insects. They are strong, active birds, and are
believed to be polygamous. The king bird of paradise (<i>Cicinnurus
regius</i>) is one of the smallest and most brilliant of the
group, and is specially distinguished by its two middle tail
feathers, the ends of which alone are webbed, and coiled into a
beautiful spiral disk of a lovely emerald green. In the red
bird of paradise (<i>Paradisea rubra</i>) the same feathers are greatly
elongated and destitute of webs, but differ from those in the other
species, in being flattened out like ribbons. They are only found
in the small island of Waigiu off the coast of New Guinea. Of
the long-billed paradise birds the most remarkable is that known
as the &ldquo;twelve-wired&rdquo; (<i>Seleucides alba</i>), its delicate yellow
plumes, twelve of which are transformed into wire-like bristles
nearly a foot long, affording a striking contrast to the dark
metallic tints of the rest of its plumage.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRDWOOD, SIR GEORGE CHRISTOPHER MOLESWORTH<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span>
(1832-&emsp;&emsp;), Anglo-Indian official and writer, son of General
Christopher Birdwood, was born at Belgaum, in the Bombay
presidency, on the 8th of December 1832. He was educated
at Plymouth grammar-school and Edinburgh University, where
he took his M.D. degree. Entering the Bombay Medical
Service in 1854, he served in the Persian War of 1856-57, and
subsequently became professor at the Grant Medical College,
registrar of the university, curator of the museum, and sheriff
at Bombay, besides acting as secretary of the Asiatic and
Horticultural societies. His work on the <i>Economic Vegetable
Products of the Bombay Presidency</i> reached its twelfth edition in
1868. He interested himself prominently also in the municipal
life of the city, where he acquired great influence and popularity.
He was obliged by ill-health in 1868 to return to England, where
he entered the revenue and statistics department of the India
Office (1871-1902). Whilst engaged there he published important
volumes on the industrial arts of India, the ancient
records of the India Office, and the first letter-book of the East
India Company. He devoted much time and energy to the
encouragement of Indian art, on various aspects of which he
wrote valuable monographs, and his name was identified with
the representation of India at all the principal international
exhibitions from 1857 to 1901. (See <i>Journal of Indian Art</i>, vol.
viii. &ldquo;The Life and Work of Sir George Birdwood.&rdquo;) His
researches on the subject of incense (<i>Trans. Linn. Soc.</i> xxvii.,
1871; <i>Ency. Brit.</i> 9th ed., &ldquo;Incense,&rdquo; 1881; revised for
the present edition by him), a good example of his mastery of
detail, have made his historical and botanical account of this
subject a classic. Nor can his lifelong association with journalism
of the best sort be overlooked. From boyhood he was
a diligent contributor of special information to magazines and
newspapers; in India he helped to convert the <i>Standard</i> into
the <i>Times of India</i>, and edited the Bombay <i>Saturday Review</i>;
and after his return to London he wrote for the <i>Pall Mall,
Athenaeum, Academy</i>, and <i>Times</i>; and with Chenery, the editor
of <i>The Times</i>, and others he took the initiative (1882) in celebrating
the anniversary of Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s death as &ldquo;Primrose
Day&rdquo; (April 19). He kept up his connexion with India
by constant contributions to the Indian press; and his long
friendships with Indian princes and the leading educated native
Indians made his intimate knowledge of the country of peculiar
value in the handling of the problems of the Indian empire.
In 1887 he was created a K.C.I.E.; and, besides being given his
LL.D. degree by Cambridge, he was also made an officer of the
Legion of Honour and a laureate of the French Academy.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIREJIK<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (Arab. <i>Bir</i>; classical, <i>Apamea-Zeugma</i>), a town of
North-West Mesopotamia, in the Aleppo vilayet, altitude 1170 ft.,
built on a limestone cliff 400 ft. high on the left bank of the
Euphrates. Pop. about 10,000, three-quarters Moslem. It is
situated at one of the most important crossings of the Euphrates,
where there was, in ancient times, a bridge of boats, and is now
a ferry on the road from Aleppo to Urfa, Diarbekr and Mosul.
Birejik corresponds actually to Apamea, which lay opposite
Zeugma, and commanded the bridge with its strong castle
(Kala Beda) now much ruined. The place seems to have had
a pre-Seleucid existence as <i>Birtha</i>, a name which revived under
Roman rule (we hear of the emperor Julian resting there on his
march into Mesopotamia, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 363), and is preserved to this
day. The ferry over an unusually deep and narrow part of the
Euphrates has been used from time immemorial in the passage
from North Syria to Haran (Charrae), Edessa and North Mesopotamia,
and was second in importance only to that at
Thapsacus, by which crossed the route to Babylon and South
Mesopotamia. Birejik was the scene of an unusually cruel
massacre and persecution of Armenians in 1895.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIREN<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Bühren</span>), <b>ERNST JOHANN</b> (1690-1772), duke of
Courland, was the grandson of a groom in the service of Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page980" id="page980"></a>980</span>
Jacob III. of Courland, who bestowed upon him a small estate,
which Biren&rsquo;s father inherited and where Biren himself was
born. He received what little education he had at the academy
of Königsberg, from which he was expelled for riotous conduct.
In 1714 he set out to seek his fortune in Russia, and unsuccessfully
solicited a place at the shabby court of the princess Sophia
Charlotte, the consort of the tsarevich Alexius. Returning to
Mittau, he succeeded in gaining a footing at court there through
one of his sisters, who was the fancy of the ruling minister,
Peter Bestuzhev, whose established mistress was no less a
person than the young duchess Anne Ivanovna. During his
patron&rsquo;s absence, Biren, a handsome, insinuating fellow, succeeded
in supplanting him in the favour of Anne, and procuring
the disgrace and banishment of Bestuzhev and his family. From
henceforth to the end of her life Biren&rsquo;s influence over the
duchess was paramount. On the elevation of Anne to the
Russian throne in 1740, Biren, who had in the meantime
married a Fräulein von Treiden, came to Moscow, and honours
and riches were heaped upon him. At the coronation (19th
May) he was made grand-chamberlain, a count of the empire,
on which occasion he is said to have adopted the arms of the
French ducal house of Biron, and was presented with an estate
at Wenden with 50,000 crowns a year. He soon made himself
cordially detested by Russians of every class. He was not
indeed the monster of iniquity he is popularly supposed to have
been. His vices were rather of the sordid than of the satanic
order. He had insinuating manners and could make himself
very agreeable if he chose; but he was mean, treacherous,
rapacious, suspicious and horribly vindictive. During the
latter years of Anne&rsquo;s reign, Biren increased enormously in
power and riches. His apartments in the palace adjoined
those of the empress, and his liveries, furnitures and equipages
were scarcely less costly than hers. Half the bribes intended
for the Russian court passed through his coffers. He had
landed estates everywhere. A special department of state
looked after his brood mares and stallions. The magnificence
of his plate astonished the French ambassador, and the diamonds
of his duchess were the envy of princes. The climax of this
wondrous elevation was reached when, on the extinction of the
line of Kettler, the estates of Courland, in June 1737, elected
him their reigning duke. He was almost as much loathed in
Courland as in Russia; but the will of the empress was the law
of the land, and large sums of money, smuggled into Courland
in the shape of bills payable in Amsterdam to bearer, speedily
convinced the electors. On her death-bed Anne, very unwillingly
and only at his urgent entreaty, appointed him regent
during the minority of the baby emperor, Ivan VI. Her common-sense
told her that the only way she could save the man she
loved from the vengeance of his enemies after her death was
to facilitate in time his descent from his untenable position.
Finally, on the 26th of October 1740, a so-called &ldquo;positive
declaration&rdquo; signed by 194 dignitaries, in the name of the
Russian nation, conferred the regency on Biren.</p>

<p>Biren&rsquo;s regency lasted exactly three weeks. At midnight of the
19th of November 1740 he was seized in his bedroom by his
ancient rival, Field Marshal Münnich. The commission appointed
to try his case condemned him (11th of April 1741) to death
by quartering, but this sentence was commuted by the clemency
of the new regent, Anna Leopoldovna, the mother of Ivan VI., to
banishment for life at Pelin in Siberia. All Biren&rsquo;s vast property
was confiscated, including his diamonds, worth £600,000.
For twenty-two years the ex-regent disappeared from the high
places of history. He re-emerges for a brief moment in 1762,
when the philo-German Peter III. summoned him to court.
He was now too old to be in any one&rsquo;s way, and that, no doubt,
was the reason why Catherine II. re-established him (1763) in
his duchy, which he bequeathed to his son Peter. Misfortune
had chastened him, and the last years of his rule were just and
even benevolent, if somewhat autocratic. He died at Mittau,
his capital, on the 28th of December 1772.</p>

It is square and stiff, being made of a framework of cardboard

Its colour varies with the rank of the wearer, that of the pope

head-dress, its use not being confined to liturgical functions.
In these functions, moreover, its use is strictly limited; <i>e.g.</i>
it is worn at low masses by the priest only when he goes to and
from the altar, at high masses also when the celebrant sits
during the singing of the <i>Kyrie, Gloria</i> and Creed, and at
processions when these take place outside the church and are not
sacramental, and so on.</p>

<p>Though the form of the biretta, devised in the 17th century,
is peculiar to the Roman Church, it is but a variant of the
original <i>biretum</i>, which developed in various countries into
head-coverings of different shapes and significance. At the
outset there was little to distinguish the <i>biretum</i> from the <i>pileus</i>
or <i>pileolus</i> (skull-cap), a non-liturgical cap worn by dignitaries
of the Church under the mitre and even under the biretta. When
the word <i>biretum</i> first appears in the 13th century, it practically
means no more than &ldquo;cap,&rdquo; and is used as a synonym of <i>pileus</i>.
As an ecclesiastical vestment the cap can be traced, under the
name of <i>pileus</i>, to the 12th century; under that of <i>infula</i>, to the
end of the 10th. It would seem to have been worn by the cantors
as a protection against cold. The same utilitarian reason led
to its introduction among the clergy generally. Thus in 1243
Pope Innocent IV. granted leave to the Benedictines of St
Augustine&rsquo;s at Canterbury, and to those of Winchester, to wear
the <i>pileus</i> in choir. With the extension of its use, too, the
custom grew up (<i>c.</i> 1300) of investing clerks with the <i>biretum</i>
as the symbol of the transfer of a benefice, a custom which
survives, in Roman Catholic countries, in the solemn delivery
of the red biretta by the head of the state to newly created
cardinals, who afterwards go to Rome to receive the red hat.
This red biretta is called the <i>zucchetto</i>.</p>

<p>This use of the <i>biretum</i> as a symbol of office or dignity was not
confined to the clergy. With various modifications of form it
was worn by all persons of standing, <i>e.g.</i> barons, judges, and
doctors and masters of the universities. The <i>biretum</i> was also
used in the investiture of laymen with office, <i>e.g.</i> a duke or the
prefect of the city of Rome (Du Cange, <i>Gloss.</i> s.v. <i>birretum</i>).
The &ldquo;cap of maintenance&rdquo; or &ldquo;cap of estate,&rdquo; still borne before
the British sovereign on state occasions, is a barret-cap
of the type of the 14th and 15th centuries; it is of
crimson velvet, turned up with ermine. By the 16th century
the barret-cap had become the common head-gear of
all people of substance, men and women. It was flat, square
or round, sometimes with edges that could be turned up or down
according to convenience, and was often elaborately decorated.
By the 17th century it had given place in ordinary civil life to the
brimmed hat; but in various shapes it still survives as official
head-gear in many European countries: the <i>Barett</i>, worn in
church by the Lutheran clergy, in the courts by German lawyers,
and by the deans and rectors of the universities, the <i>barrette</i> of
French judges and barristers, the &ldquo;black cap&rdquo; of the English
judge, and the &ldquo;college cap&rdquo; familiar in English and American
universities, and vulgarly known as the &ldquo;mortar-board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ecclesiastical developments of the <i>biretum</i> are
not without interest and significance. Originally this had been a
round cap, low or moderately high, slightly bulging out at the
top, and ornamented with a round knob. By the 16th century,
both in England and on the continent, a tendency had begun to
emphasize the ridges of the sutures and thus produce a square
shape. Henceforth the evolution followed different lines. In
England, in the 17th century, the square flat top began to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page981" id="page981"></a>981</span>
enlarged, forming a rim of thick stuff projecting beyond the
close-fitting cap. This was the &ldquo;square cap&rdquo; so virulently
denounced by the Puritans as a symbol of High Church Erastianism.
With the triumph of High Church principles at the Restoration
it was natural that a loyal clergy should desire to emphasize
this squareness, and the consequent exaggeration of the square
top of the cap necessitated a further stiffening. In the 18th
century, accordingly, the top began to be made of a board of
wood or card covered with cloth, the close-fitting cap proper
retired farther from the edges, the knob developed into a long
tassel, and the evolution of the modern &ldquo;college cap&rdquo; was
complete (see fig. 1).</p>

<p>On the continent, meanwhile, in the Roman Catholic Church,
the <i>biretum</i> had also developed into its present characteristic form, and by a
very similar process.
By the end
of the 16th century
the square
shape was everywhere
prevalent;
at the beginning
of the 17th century cardboard
was introduced
to stiffen the sides
and emphasize
the squareness,
and the actual
form of the biretta,
as described
above, had
become fixed (see fig. 2). Only in Spain has the biretta continued
to be worn without the raised ridges.</p>

<p>The use of the Roman biretta has been introduced by a certain
number of the clergy into the Anglican Church. It is clear that
there is no historical justification for this; for though both
college cap and biretta are developed from the same &ldquo;square cap,&rdquo;
the biretta in its actual shape is strictly associated with the
post-Reformation Roman Church, and its actual ceremonial use is of
late growth. Braun (<i>Liturgische Gewandung</i>, p. 513) thinks
that the symbolism of the cross may have had some influence
in fixing and propagating
the square
shape, and he
quotes a decree of
the synod of Aix
(1585) ordering the
clergy to wear a
biretta sewn in the
form of a cross
(<i>biretum in modum
crucis consutum, ut
ecclesiasticos homines
decet</i>). So far
as the legality of
the use of the biretta in the Church of England is concerned,
this was pronounced by Sir R. Phillimore in the Court
of Arches (<i>Elphinstone</i> v. <i>Purchas</i>, 1870) to be legal &ldquo;as a
protection to the head when needed,&rdquo; but this decision was
reversed on appeal by the judicial committee of the privy
council (<i>Hebbert</i> v. <i>Purchas</i>, 1871). Of late years the old square
cap of soft padded cloth or velvet has been revived in the
Anglican Church by some dignitaries.</p>

of the Folkungeätten, which had so much to say for itself in
early Swedish history, was created jarl of Bjälbo by King Erik
Eriksson in 1248 and married the king&rsquo;s sister. On Erik&rsquo;s death
(1250) Birger&rsquo;s son Valdemar was elected king while his father

laid the foundations of Sweden&rsquo;s oversea empire. He also built
Stockholm, and enriched it by making it the chief mart for the
trade of Lübeck, with which city he concluded a commercial
treaty. As a lawgiver also Birger laboured strenuously in the
interests of civilization. In his old age he married the daughter
of King Abel. There is a fine statue of the great jarl in the

the southern boundary is a lofty range of barren hills known as
Kuh i Bakeran. Through the valley runs the Khusp river,
which loses itself in the desert towards the west; it is, however,
generally dry. The water-supply of the town and of the 70 or 80

<p><span class="bold">BIRKBECK, GEORGE<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (1776-1841), English physician and
philanthropist, was born at Settle in Yorkshire on the 10th of
January 1776. He early evinced a strong predilection for
scientific pursuits; and in 1799, after graduating as doctor of
medicine, he was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy
at the Andersonian Institution of Glasgow. In the following
year he delivered, for the benefit of the working-classes, a
gratuitous course of scientific lectures, which were continued
during the two following years and proved eminently successful.
He removed to London in 1804, and there he endeavoured to
prosecute his philanthropic schemes, at first without much
encouragement, but ultimately with marked success. In 1823
he contributed to found the Mechanics&rsquo; Institute, the name of
which was afterwards changed to Birkbeck Institution or
College, in honour of its founder. He was appointed director
of the institute, which he had originally endowed with the sum
of £3700, and held the office till his death on the 1st of December
1841. The sphere of usefulness of the institution was gradually
enlarged, and an enlargement of the buildings was carried out
in 1883-1885. The college now holds day and evening classes
in many of the sciences, in literature, languages and art.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRKENFELD,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> a town of Germany, capital of the principality
of the same name, on the Zimmerbach, 25 m. S.E. of Trier and
on the main line of railway from Bingerbrück to Neunkirchen.
Pop. 2500. Close by, on an eminence, lie the ruins of the castle
of Birkenfeld, dating from the 14th century, once the residence
of the counts palatine of Zweibrücken. The town has an Evangelical
and a Roman Catholic church, a grand-ducal high school
and a hospital. Besides brewing and tanning, its industries
include the manufacture of tobacco and chicory. There is also
a considerable trade in cattle.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Principality of Birkenfeld</span> is hilly and well-forested;
agriculture prospers on the cleared lands, and fruit is grown in
the valley of the Nahe, the principal stream. Ironstone and
roofing slates are quarried, and there is some industry in
agate-polishing and the manufacture of trinkets. The principality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page982" id="page982"></a>982</span>
has an area of 312 sq. m. and a population (1900) of 43,409,
chiefly Protestants. It is formed out of the former lordships of
Dachstuhl and Oberstein, of part of the ancient countship of
Sponheim, and sections of the duchy of Jülich, which were
granted to the grand-duke of Oldenburg by the congress of
Vienna in 1815. It is entirely an <i>enclave</i> in Prussian territory,
and though it is represented in the Oldenburg diet, it is governed
by a separate <i>Regierungskollegium</i>, consisting of a president and
two members, who are responsible to the Oldenburg ministry.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BIRKENHEAD,<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> a municipal, county and parliamentary
borough, and seaport of Cheshire, England, on the river Mersey,
195 m. N.W. of London. Pop. (1901) 110,915. It lies opposite
Liverpool, on the east shore of the peninsula of Wirral, and is
served by the Birkenhead (London &amp; North-Western and Great
Western joint) and the Wirral railways. It is wholly of modern
growth, although the name of Byrkhed is traced to the forest
which is believed to have extended between the mouths of the
Dee and the Ribble in Lancashire. A Benedictine monastery
was founded (<i>c.</i> 1150) by Hamon de Mascy, third baron of
Dunham Massey, and dedicated to St Mary and St James. It
drew its main revenues from tolls levied at the Mersey ferry; and
its prior sat in the parliament of the earls of Chester, enjoying
all the dignities and privileges of a Palatinate baron. A fine
crypt, along with remains of the prior&rsquo;s lodging, refectory and
chapel, may still be viewed, as the priory was purchased by
private subscription and handed over to the municipality in 1896.</p>

<p>The rise of Birkenhead, from a hamlet of some 50 inhabitants
in 1818 to its present importance, was due in the first place to
the foresight and enterprise of William Laird, who purchased
in 1824 a few acres of land on the banks of a marshy stream,
known as Wallasey Pool, which flowed into the Mersey about
2 m. west of the village. Among other engineers, Telford and
Stephenson favoured the project of converting Wallasey Pool
into a great basin for shipping; but, largely owing to the fears
of Liverpool lest a formidable rival should thus be created, it was
not until 1843 that parliamentary powers were obtained, and the
work entrusted to James Rendel, who finished it in less than
five years. The docks, which covered an area of 7 acres, were
opened in 1847, and after thrice changing hands were made
over in 1858 to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, a body
created by act of 1857, to control the harbourage on both sides
of the river.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the town itself grew rapidly. In 1833 an act
was passed for paving, watching, cleansing and improving the
streets; as well as for the regulation of police, and the establishment
of a market. The Improvement Commissioners constituted
by this act included the mayor, bailiffs and four aldermen of
Liverpool, under whose care the main streets were laid out on a
regular plan, intersecting one another at right angles; and the
first iron tramway in England was laid down. Electricity was
subsequently applied to the tramway system. Noteworthy
public buildings are St Aidan&rsquo;s College, a large brick building in
Tudor style, for the use of Anglican students in theology; the
market hall (1843); town hall, a free library with branches,
borough hospital, built at the cost of Sir John Laird; and many
schools both public and private, including the industrial schools
built as a memorial to Albert, prince consort, at the cost of Sir
W. Jackson, and the school of art, given by Sir John Laird.
There are many handsome modern churches, all built since 1821.
Roman Catholics are especially numerous, owing to the presence
of a large Irish population. The town is well furnished with
open spaces. Birkenhead Park was opened in 1847, Mersey
Park in 1885; while a tract of moorland 6 m. distant in the
township of Thurstaston, was allotted to the borough of Birkenhead
in 1887; and Meols Common, comprising over 50 acres of
pastureland on the shores of Liverpool Bay, was made over to
the corporation in 1900.</p>

<p>The increase of railway accommodation has been swift. In
1878 the old Monks Ferry station on the Great Western system
was superseded by the opening of the Woodside passenger
station, and a few years later the Birkenhead town station was
opened. In 1886 the Mersey tunnel, connecting Birkenhead
with Liverpool, was opened by the prince of Wales. The system
extends from Rock Ferry and Park stations on the Cheshire
side to the low-level at Central Station in Liverpool, and has
connexions on the Cheshire side with the Great Western,
North-Western, Wirral and various local lines. The Wrexham,
Mold &amp; Connah&rsquo;s Quay railway, which was taken over by the
Great Central company in 1905, helped to bring the mineral
wealth of Flint and North Wales generally into the Birkenhead
docks.</p>

<p>Woodside Ferry may still be regarded as the principal entrance
to Birkenhead and the Wirral from Liverpool. The exclusive
right of ferryage was granted to the priory in 1332. In
1842 the Birkenhead Commissioners purchased it, under an act
of parliament, from the lord of the manor, Mr F.R. Price. In
1897 the corporation further acquired the rights over the Rock
Ferry and the New Ferry at the southern end of the town.
Despite competition from the Mersey tunnel, these ferries
continue to transport millions of passengers annually, and have
a considerable share in the heavy goods traffic.</p>

<p>Though at the outset a mere commercial offshoot of Liverpool,
Birkenhead has acquired a large export trade in coal and manufactured
articles, importing guano, grain and cattle in return.
Iron foundries, breweries, oil-cake and seed mills also exist side
by side with such immense engineering and shipbuilding works
as the Britannia Works, Canada Works, and, above all, Laird&rsquo;s
shipbuilding works, where several early iron vessels were built,
and many cruisers and battleships have been launched. Huge
warehouses and sheds have been erected along the quays for
the storage of freight. In 1847 the Birkenhead Dock Warehousing
Company opened its first warehouse, capable of holding
80,000 tons of goods. A line called the Dock Extension railway
was carried round the whole, and the company erected, for their
workmen, the Dock Cottages. This entire property is now
under the authority of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.
The pile of buildings known as the corn warehouses are traversed
by a canal which gives access to its several departments, and are
provided with mechanical grain-elevators. There are also
extensive lairages for live-stock, and cold storage for dead meat.
On the north and north-east, and partly on the east, Birkenhead
is bounded by its docks, which extend, for a distance exceeding
2 m., from the landing-stage at Woodside Ferry to the Wallasey
Bridge. Of these the principal are the Egerton, Morpeth,
Morpeth Branch and Wallasey Docks; while the Alfred Dock,
with its three entrances, nineteen pairs of lock-gates, 8 acres
of water, and 460 lin. yds. of quay-space, fulfils the part of
an entrance-lock to the whole system. The great Float, now
occupying the site of Wallasey Pool, separates Birkenhead from
Poulton-cum-Seacombe in the parish of Wallasey. It forms an
immense dock of 120 acres, with a quay-space of about 5 m.;
and communicates on the E. with a low-water basin of about
14 acres and with the Alfred Dock; on the S.E. with the Morpeth,
Morpeth Branch and Egerton Docks. The Morpeth Dock (about
11 acres, quay-space 1299 lin. yds.) is in communication with
the Morpeth Branch Dock (about 3½ acres, quay-space 600 lin.
yds.); both being set apart for the use of steamers. The total
water-space of these docks amounts to 165 acres, and the lineal
quay-space is about 9½ m. The entrances to the Birkenhead
Docks are capable of docking the largest class of steamers afloat.
The massive iron bridges across the dock entrances are opened
and closed by hydraulic power, which is likewise applied to the
cranes, coal-hoists, warehouse-lifts and other machinery about
the docks. At the extreme western end of the West Float
are three large graving docks, two about 750 ft. in length,
and 130 and 80 ft. respectively in width; while the largest
measures about 900 ft. in length and 130 ft. in width.</p>

<p>In 1861 Birkenhead was created a parliamentary borough,
returning one member. In 1877 it received a municipal charter,
the boundaries of the borough including the suburban townships
of Tranmere, Claughton, Oxton and part of Higher Bebington.
The borough is under a mayor, 14 aldermen and 42 councillors.
Area, 3848 acres.</p>

county, Alabama, U.S.A., in the north-central part of the state,
96 m. N.W. of Montgomery, at an altitude of 600 ft. It is served
by the Southern, the Louisville &amp; Nashville, the Seaboard
Air Line, the Central of Georgia, the Alabama Great Southern
(of the Queen &amp; Crescent Route), the Illinois Central, the Atlanta,
Birmingham &amp; Atlantic, the Birmingham Southern
(for freight only), and the Kansas City, Memphis &amp; Birmingham
(Frisco system) railways. Pop. (1890) 26,178; (1900) 38,415,
of whom 16,575 were of negro descent, and 1776 were foreign-born;
(1910) 132,685. Birmingham is situated in Jones Valley,
between two mountains which lie south-east and north-west of
the city. Its streets are wide and well constructed, and there
are sixteen public parks, three of which, East Lake, Lakeview
and Capitol, are particularly attractive. Among the principal
buildings are the First National bank, the immense Union
station and the Saint Vincent hospital; besides several fine office
and school buildings (including the beautiful manual training
high school) and churches. Although the state constitution
restricts municipal investments, a Waring or &ldquo;Separate&rdquo;
sewage system has been established. The most important
educational institutions are the Birmingham medical college
and college of pharmacy; the Birmingham dental college;
a school of art and a conservatory of music. At East Lake
station, in the north-east of the city, is Howard College (Baptist;
founded at Marion, Perry county, in 1841 as an academy;
granted first collegiate degrees in 1848; opened in East Lake
in 1887); and 2 m. west of the city is the North Alabama Conference
College (Methodist Episcopal South), opened in 1897.</p>

<p>Birmingham, situated in an immensely rich iron, coal and
limestone region, is the principal manufacturing centre in the
state, and the most important centre for the production and
manufacture of iron in the southern states. In the decade
1890-1900 the value of the products of Birmingham&rsquo;s manufactories
increased 78.9% from $7,064,248 to $12,581,066; in
1900 establishments under the &ldquo;factory system&rdquo; produced
goods valued at $8,599,418, in 1905 at $7,592,958, a decrease
of 11.7%.</p>

<p>Immediately outside the city limits in 1905 there were many
large manufactories, including the repair shops of the Southern
railroad; iron and steel, car wheels and cotton-oil were among
the products of the suburban factories. In Jefferson county
there were in 1900 more than 300 mining and manufacturing
establishments, engaged, chiefly, in the production of iron, coal
and coke, and a majority of these are in Birmingham and its suburban
towns. A short distance south of the city is Red Mountain,
25 m. long and about 225 ft. high, rich in hematite iron ore;
valuable limestone deposits are found some 30 m. distant, and
in the vicinity are three great coalfields, the Warrior, the Coosa
and the Cahaba. These natural advantages make possible the
production of pig iron at an unusually low cost. In 1900 the
Birmingham district produced six-sevenths of the total pig iron
exported from the United States, and in 1902 nine-tenths
of Alabama&rsquo;s coal, coke and pig iron; in 1905 Jefferson county
produced 67.5% of the total iron and steel product of the state,
and 62.5% of the pig iron produced by the state. The first
steel plant in the southern states was established at Birmingham
in 1897; in 1902, at Ensley, one of the suburbs, there were 10
furnaces controlled by one company. The city has also a large
trade in cotton, the annual receipts averaging about 100,000 bales.
Among the manufactures are cotton goods, cotton-seed oil,
yarn, furniture and machinery. Birmingham also has important
lumber interests.</p>

<p>The city is a product of the industrial transformation in the
southern states since the Civil War. In 1870 the site was a
cotton field, where two railways, the South &amp; North, and the
Alabama &amp; Chattanooga, now part respectively of the Louisville
&amp; Nashville and the Southern System, met, 2 m. from
Elyton. In 1871 a land company, promoted by railway officials,
founded Birmingham. Within four months the population was
1200; by 1873 it was 2500; in 1880 it was 3086; and in 1890
it had reached 26,178.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRMINGHAM,<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> a city and a municipal, county, and parliamentary
borough, the metropolis of one of the greatest industrial
districts in England. Pop. (1901) 522,204. It lies in the north-west
of Warwickshire, but its suburbs extend into Staffordshire
on the north and west, and into Worcestershire on the south.
It is 113 m. north-west from London by the London &amp; North-Western
railway, lying on the loop line between Rugby and
Stafford; it is also served by the northern line of the Great
Western, and by the north and west (Derby-Bristol) line of the
Midland railway.</p>

<p><i>Site.</i>&mdash;Birmingham, built upon the New Red Sandstone, is
situated in the valleys of the Rea and other small feeders of the
river Tame, near their sources, and upon the rising ground
between these valleys. The site is, therefore, boldly undulating,
varying from 200 to 600 ft. above sea-level, steadily rising
towards the north and west, while the well-marked line of the
Lickey hills skirts the site on the south-west, extending thence
south-eastward. From the high ground to the south-east
Birmingham thus presents the appearance of a vast semicircular
amphitheatre, the masses of houses broken by innumerable
factory-chimneys; the whole scene conveying a remarkable
impression of a community of untiring industrial activity.
The area of the town is nearly 20 sq. m., the greatest length from
north to south 7 m., and the greatest breadth about 4 m. Yet
Birmingham is a fraction only of an industrial district, of which
it forms the south-eastern extremity, which itself resembles
one vast city, and embraces such famous manufacturing towns
as Dudley, Wolverhampton, Walsall, Wednesbury and many
others. This is the district commonly known as the &ldquo;Black
Country,&rdquo; which forms part of the South Staffordshire industrial
district. Birmingham, however, does not lie actually within
the &ldquo;Black Country&rdquo; properly so-called.</p>

<p><i>Streets and Buildings.</i>&mdash;The plan of the town, as dictated by
the site, is irregular; the streets are mostly winding, and often
somewhat narrow. In the centre are several fine thoroughfares,
containing nearly all the most important buildings. New Street,
Corporation Street and Colmore Row are the chief of these.
At the western end of New Street is a fine group of buildings,
including the council house and art gallery, the town hall and
post office. The council house and art gallery, begun in 1874
and completed in 1881, is in Renaissance style, and the material
is Darley Dale, Spinkwell and Wrexham stone. The entrance
is surmounted with a pediment filled with groups of excellent
sculpture. The erection of that part which forms the art gallery
was the work of the gas committee, to whom the council granted
the site on condition that they would build such a gallery over
their own office, the council having no powers at the time to
raise the required funds. The art gallery contains a fine collection
of modern paintings, including masterpieces of David Cox,
Millais, Hunt, Henry Moore, Albert Moore, Briton-Riviere and
Burne-Jones. In the industrial hall are rich stores of Oriental
metal work, Limoges enamel, English and foreign glass and
Japanese ceramics. In the side galleries are various textiles,
and Persian, Rhodian, Grès de Flandres and other pottery.
There is a remarkable collection of Wedgwood. Notable also
is the collection of arms, which is probably the most complete in
existence. The purchase of pictures has been made from time
to time by means of an art gallery purchase fund of £12,000,
privately contributed and placed under the control of the corporation.
Many valuable works of art are the gift of individuals.
In 1906 plans were obtained for additional municipal offices and
another art gallery on a site on the opposite side of Edmund
Street from the council house. The town hall, completed in
1850, is severely classic, modelled upon a Greek temple. The
lower stage consists of a plinth or basement, 23 ft. high, upon
which is reared a facade of peripteral character, with eight
Corinthian columns (36 ft. high) at the two principal fronts, and
thirteen columns on each side. These columns (imitated from
those of the temple of Jupiter Stator at Rome) support a bold
and enriched cornice, finished at each end with a lofty pediment
and entablature. The exterior of the hall is built of Anglesea
marble. The interior consists chiefly of a regularly-built room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page984" id="page984"></a>984</span>
designed specially for meetings and concerts, with an orchestra
containing a fine organ. The hall seats upwards of 2000 persons,
but when cleared of benches, as is the case at great political
meetings, over 5000 may find standing room. The Midland
Institute, adjacent to the town hall on the west, has a fine
lecture theatre. To the south lie the post office, the inland
revenue office and Queen&rsquo;s College. To the north is the Gothic
building of Mason College, an institution merged in the university.
The Central free library, adjoining the Midland Institute,
was rebuilt in 1879, after a fire which destroyed the fine Shakespeare
library, the Cervantes collection, and a large series of
books on, and antiquities of, Warwickshire, known as the
Staunton collection. The Shakespeare series was as far as
possible replaced, and the whole forms one of the largest reference
and lending libraries in England. Edmund Street and
Colmore Row are fine thoroughfares running parallel in a
north-easterly direction from either side of the council house;
in the first the principal building is the school of art, in the
second are several noteworthy private buildings. Both terminate at
Snow Hill station, that of the Great Western railway. New
Street station, that of the London &amp; North Western and Midland
railways, lies close to the street of that name, fronted by
the Queen&rsquo;s hotel. The station is nearly a quarter of a mile in
length. The roof of the older portion consists of a vast arch of
glass and iron, carried on pillars on each side, and measuring
1100 ft. in length, 80 ft. in height, and 212 ft. in width in a single
span. The building of the Royal Society of Artists fronts New
Street itself with a fine classic portico; here are also the exchange
(Gothic) and the grammar school of King Edward VI., a Perpendicular
building dating from 1840, designed by Sir Charles
Barry. Corporation Street was the outcome of a great &ldquo;Improvement
scheme&rdquo; initiated in 1875, with the object of clearing
away a mass of insanitary property from the centre of the town
and of constructing a main thoroughfare from the centre to the
north-eastern outlet, starting from New Street, near the railway
station to Bull Street, and thence continuing to the Aston
Road. The scheme received parliamentary sanction in 1876,
and was finished in 1882 at a cost of £1,520,657. This led to an
almost total extinction of the residential quarter in the centre
of the town. The finest building in this handsome street is the
Victoria assize courts. The foundation stone was laid by Queen
Victoria in 1887, after Birmingham had been created an assize
district; the building was completed in 1891. There is a handsome
entrance, and within is a great hall, 80 ft. by 40, with a
series of stained-glass windows. The exterior is red, and highly
ornamented in the style of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Among other noteworthy buildings are the county court,
education offices and military drill hall. Among a fine series
of statues and monuments may be mentioned the statue of
Nelson by Richard Westmacott, in the Bull Ring; those of
Joseph Sturge, at the Five Ways, and of Thomas Attwood, the
founder of the Political Union, in Stephenson Place, both by
J.E. Thomas; James Watt, a singularly beautiful work, in
Ratcliff Place, by Alexander Munro; Sir Robert Peel, in New
Street, by Peter Hollins; Albert, prince consort, in the council
house, by J.H. Foley; and Queen Victoria, by Thomas Woolner;
Sir Rowland Hill, in the hall of the post office, by Matthew
Noble; and Dr Priestley, in New Street, by F.J. Williamson.
There is also a fountain behind the town hall, commemorative
of the mayoralty of Mr Joseph Chamberlain, and flanked by
statues of Sir Josiah Mason, and George Dawson, who took
active part in the municipal reform movement previous to
Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s years of office. Sir Francis Chantrey&rsquo;s famous
statue of James Watt is in a special chapel at Handsworth
church.</p>

<p><i>Suburbs.</i>&mdash;The principal streets radiating from central
Birmingham to the suburbs are served by electric tramways
worked by the corporation, and also by motor omnibuses.
The principal suburbs are as follows. Edgbaston and Harborne
lie south-west of the centre of the city, being approached by
Broad Street. These form a residential district principally
inhabited by the richer classes, and owing to the enforcement
of strict rules by the ground landlord, retain a remarkable semi-rural
character, almost every house having a garden. Here,
moreover, are Calthorpe Park, the botanical gardens, and the
large private grounds attached to Edgbaston Hall, also the
Warwickshire county cricket ground. To the south of Edgbaston,
however, are the growing manufacturing districts of Selly Oak
and Bourneville, and south of these, Northfield and King&rsquo;s
Norton, in Worcestershire. The districts to the east of central
Birmingham are Balsall Heath, Sparkbrook, Small Heath and
Saltley. On the south-east is the residential suburb of Moseley,
and on the east that of Yardley. Between Moseley and King&rsquo;s
Heath to the south, is Highbury, the seat of Mr Joseph Chamberlain,
whose active interest in the affairs of the town, both during
his mayoralty (1873-1876) and at other times, was a principal
factor in such works as the municipalization of the gas and water
supply, the Corporation Street improvement, and the foundation
of Birmingham University. On the east side the transition from
town to country is clearly marked. This, however, is not the
case on the west side, where the borough of Smethwick adjoins
Birmingham, and the roads through West Bromwich and towards
Oldbury and Dudley have the character of continuous streets.
On this side are Soho and Handsworth, which gives name to a
parliamentary division of Staffordshire. To the north lies
Aston Manor, a municipal borough of itself, with Perry Bar
beyond. To the north-east a populous district extends towards
the town of Sutton Coldfield. Aston Hall is a fine Jacobean
mansion standing in an extensive park. Aston Lower Grounds
is an adjacent pleasure-ground. Besides these and the Edgbaston
grounds the chief parks are Summersfield Park,
towards Smethwick; Soho Park; Victoria Park, Handsworth;
Adderley Park, towards Saltley; and Victoria Park, Small
Heath. There is a race-course at Castle Bromwich, 3 m. east of
the town.</p>

<p><i>Churches and Religion.</i>&mdash;Birmingham is not rich in ecclesiastical
architecture. It became a bishopric under the
Bishoprics of Southwark and Birmingham Act 1904, including the
archdeaconry of Birmingham and the rural deanery of Handsworth,
previously in the diocese of Worcester. Before 1821 it was in the
diocese of Lichfield. There were formerly a religious house, the
priory of St Thomas the Apostle, and a Gild of the Holy Cross,
an association partly religious and partly charitable, having a
chantry in the parish church. The possessions of the priory
went to the crown at the dissolution, and the building was
destroyed before the close of the 16th century. The lands of the
Gild of the Holy Cross were granted by Edward VI. to trustees
for the support of the free grammar school. Until 1715 there
was but one parish church, St Martin&rsquo;s, a rectory, having the
tithes of the entire parish of Birmingham. St Martin&rsquo;s was
erected about the middle of the 13th century, but in the course
of ages was so disfigured, internally and externally, as to present
no traces, except in the tower and spire, of its former character.
In 1853 the tower was found to be in a dangerous condition, and
together with the spire was rebuilt. In 1873 the remaining part
of the old church was removed without disturbing the monuments,
and a larger edifice was erected in its place. St. Philip&rsquo;s,
a stately Italian structure, designed by Archer, a pupil of Wren,
was the next church erected. It was consecrated in 1715,
enlarged in 1884, and became the pro-cathedral on the foundation
of the diocese. It contains a rich series of stained-glass windows
by Burne-Jones. Then followed St Bartholomew&rsquo;s in 1749,
St Mary&rsquo;s in 1774, St Paul&rsquo;s in 1779, St James&rsquo;s, Ashted, in 1791,
and others. St Alban&rsquo;s is a good example of J.L. Pearson&rsquo;s
work, and Edgbaston church is a picturesque Perpendicular
structure.</p>

<p>Under the Commonwealth Birmingham was a stronghold of
Puritanism. Clarendon speaks of it and the neighbourhood as
&ldquo;the most eminently corrupted of any in England.&rdquo; Baxter,
on the other hand, commending the garrison of Coventry, says
it contained &ldquo;the most religious men of the parts round about,
especially from Birmingham.&rdquo; The traditional reputation for
Nonconformity is maintained by the town, all varieties of
dissenters being numerous and influential. The Unitarians, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page985" id="page985"></a>985</span>
oldest body established here, have among their chapels a handsome
structure in Bristol Road, the Old Meeting, which in 1885
replaced the building in which the congregation was formed on
the Presbyterian model by a number of ministers ejected under
the Act of Uniformity. Another chapel, the New Meeting, in
Moor Street, is memorable as having been the place of Dr Joseph
Priestley&rsquo;s ministerial labours from 1780 onwards. In 1862 the
Unitarians removed from this place to a new Gothic edifice,
called the church of the Messiah, in Broad Street, where they
preserve a monument of Priestley, with a medallion portrait in
profile, and an inscription written by Priestley&rsquo;s friend, Dr Parr.
The first meeting-house of the Society of Friends dates from
about 1690. Among Independent chapels, that of Carr&rsquo;s Lane
had John Angell James and Robert William Dale as ministers.
The Baptists first erected a chapel in Cannon Street in 1738.
The Wesleyan Methodists were established in Birmingham by
John Wesley himself in 1745, when he was roughly handled
while preaching on Gosta Green. In 1903 a very fine central hall,
with lofty tower, was opened by this body, in the style of the
Renaissance, fronting upon Corporation, Ryder and Dalton
streets. The Presbyterians have also places of worship, and the
Jews have a synagogue. From the revolution of 1688 until
1789 the Roman Catholics had no place of worship here; but
Birmingham is now a Roman Catholic bishopric. The cathedral
of St Chad was built from the designs of A.W. Pugin. At
Erdington, towards Sutton Coldfield, is a large Benedictine Abbey
(1897) of the Beuron congregation, founded as a monastery in
1876; and in the vicinity, at Oscott, is St Mary&rsquo;s College, where
the chapel is a fine example of Pugin&rsquo;s work. Cardinal Newman
was superior of the Oratory of St Philip Neri from its foundation
in 1851.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;The government of the town resided originally
in the high and low bailiffs, both officers chosen at the court
of the lord of the manor, and acting as his deputies. The system
was a loose one, but by degrees it became somewhat organized,
and crown writs were addressed to the bailiffs. In 1832, when
the town was enfranchised, they were made the returning officers.
About the beginning of the 19th century, however, a more regular
system was instituted, by an act creating a body of street commissioners,
who acted for the parish of Birmingham, the hamlets
outside its boundaries having similar boards of their own. The
annoyance and difficulty caused by these bodies, thirteen in
number, led to a demand for the incorporation of Birmingham
as a borough; and a charter was accordingly granted by the
crown in 1838, vesting the general government in a mayor,
sixteen aldermen and forty-seven councillors. The powers of
this body were, however, unusually restricted, the other local
governing bodies remaining in existence. It was not until 1851
that an act of parliament was obtained, abolishing all governing
authorities excepting the town council, and transferring all
powers to this body. Another local act was obtained in 1862,
and in 1883 these various acts were combined into the Birmingham
Corporation Consolidation Act. In 1889 Birmingham was
created a city, and a grant made of an official coat of arms carrying
supporters. The title of lord mayor was conferred on the
chief magistrate in 1897. The city council consists of eighteen
aldermen and fifty-four councillors, selected from eighteen wards;
it is divided into seventeen committees, most of which consist of
eight members. The corporation is the largest employer of
labour in the borough, and is also a large landowner.</p>

<p>The gas, electric and water supplies are in its hands. The
gas supply was taken over in 1875, and the electric in 1900 for
£420,000. The local sources of water-supply are the rivers
Bourne and Blythe, the Plant Brook and the Perry Stream, and
eight deep wells. These works can provide 20 million gallons
daily in dry weather. A large area outside the city boundaries
is supplied, and in 1891, the demand having risen to nearly
17 millions a day, new sources had to be considered, and it was
determined to seek an entirely new supply in Wales. By an act
of 1892 power was given to acquire the watershed of the rivers
Elan and Claerwen, tributaries of the Wye, lying west of Rhyader
in Wales, and to construct the necessary works, the capital
authorized being £6,000,000. About £5,900,000 had been spent
when, on the 21st of July 1904, King Edward VII. formally
opened the supply. Two reservoirs on the river Elan, formed by
masonry dams from 98 to 128 ft. above the river-bed, were then
completed, the construction of the three planned on the Claerwen
being deferred until necessity should arise. Nearly a mile
below the confluence of the rivers the great Caban Coch dam,
122 ft. high, and the same in thickness at the base, and 600 ft.
long at the top, holds up the water for over 4 m. in the Elan, and
over 2 in the Claerwen, having a capacity of 1500 million gallons.
A series of thirty filter beds is included in the original scheme;
and the water travels 73.3 m. from the source to Birmingham
by gravity alone with a fall of about 170 ft. The area of the
gathering ground is 45,562 acres, the mean annual rainfall in the
district being 63 in. The complete scheme provided water for
fifty years in advance, and a maximum of 75 million gallons a
day was taken into account, in addition to 27 million gallons for
compensation water to the river. The part of the works opened
in 1904 provided about 27 million gallons of supply daily to the
city. The corporation is obliged by the act to supply towns
within 15 m. of the line of the aqueduct. A village for the
accommodation of workmen was established near the Caban Coch
dam; and the corporation adopted a modified form of the
Gothenburg system in respect of the supply of intoxicating
liquors, permitting no publican to open a licensed house.</p>

<p>The administration of the poor-law is vested in a board of
guardians of sixty members for the parish of Birmingham.
The parish of Edgbaston (wholly within the borough) is in the
poor-law union of King&rsquo;s Norton, and that part of the parish of
Aston included in the borough is in the Aston Union. There are
three workhouses&mdash;that for Birmingham parish, situated at
Birmingham Heath, is capable of receiving over 2000 inmates.
In 1882 a superintendent relieving officer was appointed, and a
system of cross-visitation started for the purpose of checking
abuses of outdoor relief. Workhouses, infirmaries and cottage
homes are managed by the board, on which women first sat in
1880. The administration of justice was performed from 1838
to 1884 by a court of quarter sessions, with a recorder, and a
court of petty sessions. In 1884 Birmingham was made an
assize district of Warwickshire. In 1905 a special juvenile
offenders&rsquo; court was initiated. The borough gaol is at Winson
Green towards Smethwick. The drainage system is managed
by the Birmingham, Tame and Rea District drainage board,
constituted in 1877, and consisting of members from the city
council and from districts outside the municipal area.</p>

<p>Birmingham was enfranchised in 1832, when two representatives
were assigned to it, and Thomas Attwood and Joshua
Scholefield, leaders of the Political Union, were elected. In 1867
three members were assigned, and in 1885 the number was
increased to seven, and a corresponding number of parliamentary
divisions created, namely Bordesley, Central, East, Edgbaston,
North, South and West. By the Provincial Local Government
Board Act of 1891 four local board districts were added to the
city of Birmingham for local government&mdash;Harborne (Staffordshire),
Balsall Heath (Worcestershire), Saltley and the rural
hamlet of Little Bromwich (Warwickshire). These districts
were by the act declared to be in the county of Warwick, though
still remaining in their respective counties for the exercise of
freehold votes. By this act the boundaries of the city were made
conterminous for parliamentary, municipal and school board
purposes. The area is 12,639 acres.</p>

<p>The population of Birmingham in 1700 was about 15,000.
In 1801 it was 73,000, and it increased rapidly through the
century. In 1891 it was 478,113 and in 1901, 522,204.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;The oldest educational institution is the grammar
school of King Edward VI., founded in 1552 out of the lands of
the Gild of the Holy Cross, then of the annual value of £21. The
endowments now yield upwards of £37,000. The principal
school included in the foundation is the boys&rsquo; high school, held
in the building in New Street. It has a classical and a modern
side, and educates about 500 boys. Adjoining it, in a new
building opened in 1896, is a large high school for girls, with 300
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page986" id="page986"></a>986</span>
pupils. There are also on the foundation seven middle schools,
called grammar schools, four for girls and three for boys, situated
in different parts of the city, and containing about 1900 pupils
altogether. The schools have numerous scholarships tenable
at the schools as well as exhibitions to the universities and other
places of higher education. Queen&rsquo;s College, founded in 1828
as a school of medicine, subsequently embraced other subjects,
though in 1882 only the medical and theological departments
were maintained. In 1882 a large part of the scientific teaching,
hitherto done by special professors in Queen&rsquo;s College, was taken
over by Mason College, and in 1892 the whole medical department
was removed to the same institution under an order from the
court of chancery. This change helped to advance the Birmingham
medical school to a position of high repute. The theological
students (Church of England) of Queen&rsquo;s College are few. The
idea of developing Queen&rsquo;s College into a university had long
existed. But it was destined to be realized in connexion with
Mason College, founded by Sir Josiah Mason in 1870. Subsequent
deeds (1874 and 1881) added Greek and Latin to the
practical, mechanical and artistic curriculum of the original
foundation, and provided that instruction may be given in all
such other subjects as the trustees may from time to time judge
necessary, while once in every fifteen years the provisions of the
deed may be varied to meet changing needs&mdash;theology only being
definitely excluded. In 1897 a new act was passed at the instance
of the trustees, creating a court of 180 members, and removing
<span class="sidenote">University.</span>
the theological restriction. A measure of popular
control is given through the appointment by the city
council of five out of the eleven trustees. In 1898 a
public meeting carried a resolution in favour of creating a university.
It was estimated that a quarter of a million was needed
to endow and equip a university on the scale proposed. Including
£50,000 offered by Mr Andrew Carnegie, an equal amount from
an anonymous donor, and the rest from local subscribers, in the
autumn of 1899, £325,000 had been subscribed, and the privy
council was at once petitioned for a charter, which was granted.
The draft provided for the incorporation of the university of
Birmingham with faculties of science, arts, medicine and commerce,
with power to grant degrees, and for its government by
a court of governors (of which women may be members), a
council and a senate. Mason College was merged in the university.
The faculty of commerce constitutes a distinctive feature
in the scheme of the university, the object being to bring its
teaching into close touch with the industrial life of the city, the
district and the kingdom. In 1905 Sir Edward Elgar (who
resigned in 1908) became the first occupant of a chair of music,
founded owing to the liberality of Mr Richard Peyton. From
the same year great strides were made in the development of the
scientific departments of the university. A site at Edgbaston
was given by Lord Calthorpe, and the erection of a complete and
costly set of buildings was undertaken.</p>

<p>The Municipal School of Art was formed by the transference
to the corporation in 1885 of the then existing school of art
and the society of arts, and by the erection of the building
in Margaret Street, the site having already been given
and a portion of the cost provided by private donors.
There are one central school and two branch schools. Evening
classes are also held in some of the provided schools. The
Midland Institute, the building of which was founded in 1855,
and enlarged subsequently, includes a general literary and an
industrial department. A marked development took place
in 1885, when, fresh room having been provided by the removal
of the school of art hitherto held in the building, the industrial
department was greatly enlarged, resulting in the creation of one
of the best metallurgical schools in the kingdom. The Municipal
Technical School was established in 1893 in the building of the
Midland Institute, and in 1895 was housed in a fine building of its
own, in Suffolk Street, whither the whole of the scientific teaching
of the institute was transferred. It contains metallurgical and
engineering workshops and laboratories, lecture theatres for the
teaching of chemistry and physics, a women&rsquo;s department, and
rooms for the teaching of machine drawing and building construction.
Among other educational foundations may be mentioned
a number of industrial schools, reformatories and private
schools of a good class.</p>

<p>The principal libraries are the Birmingham library, founded
in 1798 by Dr Priestley, in a modern building, the Central free
library, and other free libraries in different parts of the city,
each with a lending department and a reading room.</p>

<p><i>Charities.</i>&mdash;The general hospital, the foundation of Dr Ash,
an eminent local physician, was opened in 1779. The old
building was replaced in 1897 by a splendid new one in St Mary&rsquo;s
Square, costing £206,000. The Queen&rsquo;s hospital, Bath Row,
the other large hospital of the town, was founded in 1840 by
W. Sands Cox, F.R.S., an eminent local surgeon, who also
founded the Queen&rsquo;s College as a medical school. The general
dispensary, the officers of which visit patients at their own homes,
relieves about 8000 yearly. The children&rsquo;s hospital (free) established
in 1864 by Dr Heslop, has two establishments&mdash;for out-patients
(a handsome Gothic building) in Steelhouse Lane, and
an in-patient department in Broad Street. There is also a
women&rsquo;s hospital (free) for the special diseases of women; a
lying-in charity; special hospitals for diseases of the eye, the
ear, bodily deformities, and the teeth; and a homoeopathic
hospital. The parish of Birmingham maintains a large infirmary
at the workhouse (Birmingham Heath), and a dispensary for
out-patients in Paradise Street. The majority of the hospitals
and dispensaries are free. Nearly all these medical charities
depend upon subscriptions, donations, legacies and income from
invested property. There are two public organizations for aiding
the charities, both of which were begun in Birmingham. One is
a simultaneous collection in October in churches and chapels,
on the Sunday called Hospital Sunday, established in 1859;
the other is the Saturday Hospital collection, made by the
work-people in March, which was established in 1873. A
musical festival is held triennially in aid of the general hospital.
There is a sanatorium at Blackwell, near the Lickey Hill, 10 m.
south of Birmingham, common to all the hospitals. Amongst
the non-medical charities the principal are the blind institution
and the deaf and dumb asylum, both at Edgbaston; and Sir
Josiah Mason&rsquo;s orphanage at Erdington. There are also in the
town numerous almhouses for aged persons, the chief of which
are Lench&rsquo;s Trust, the James Charities, and the Licensed
Victuallers&rsquo; asylum. Besides the general benefit societies, such
as the Oddfellows&rsquo;, Foresters&rsquo;, &amp;c., which are strongly supported
in Birmingham, the work-people have numerous clubs of a
charitable kind, and there are several important local provident
societies of a general character, with many thousand members.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;From an early period Birmingham has been a seat
of manufactures in metal. Hutton, the historian of the town,
claims for it Saxon or even British antiquity in this respect, but
without foundation. The first direct mention of Birmingham
trades is to be found in Leland&rsquo;s <i>Itinerary</i> (1538). He writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I
came through a pretty street as ever I entered into Bermingham
towne. This street, as I remember, is called Dirtey
[Deritend]. In it dwell smiths and cutlers. There be many
smithes in the towne that use to make knives and all manner
of cutlery tooles, and many lorimers that make bittes, and a
great many naylors, so that a great part of the towne is maintained
by smithes, who have their iron and sea-cole out of
Staffordshire.&rdquo; The cutlers no longer exist, this trade having
gone to Sheffield; but the smiths remain, and the heavier cutting
tools are still largely made here. The wide importance of
Birmingham as a centre of manufactures began towards the close
of the 17th century, one great source of it being the absolute
freedom of the town, there being no gilds, companies or restrictions
of any kind; besides which the easy access to cheap coal
and iron indirectly helped the development. It is remarkable
that two important trades, now located elsewhere, were first
established here. Steel was made in Birmingham until 1797,
but then ceased to be so for about seventy years, when an
experiment in steel-making was made by a single firm. Cotton-spinning
was begun in Birmingham by John Wyatt, Lewis Paul
and Thomas Warren as early as 1730; but the speculation was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page987" id="page987"></a>987</span>
abandoned before the end of the century. The great staple
of Birmingham is metal-working in all its various forms. The
chief variety is the brass-working trade. Iron-working, though
largely carried on, is a much less important trade, works of this
kind being chiefly established in the Staffordshire district.
Jewelry, gold, silver and gilt come next to brass. The remarkable
development of this branch of industry is demonstrated by the
increase in the amount of gold and silver marked, as recorded
by the Assay office&mdash;the figures of 48,123 oz. of gold and 84,323
oz. of silver in 1870 had been increased to 363,000 oz. of gold
and nearly 3,000,000 oz. of silver by the end of the century.
Then follow &ldquo;small arms&rdquo; of all kinds. Until 1906 a Royal
Small Arms factory was maintained by the government at
Sparkbrook, but it was then transferred to the Birmingham
Small Arms Company, which had already extensive works in
the district. Buttons, hooks and eyes, pins and other articles
used for dress, constitute a large class of manufactures. Glass,
especially table glass, is a renowned staple of the town. Screws,
nails, &amp;c., are made in enormous quantities; indeed, Birmingham
has a monopoly of the English screw trade. Steel pens are also
a specialty, the name best known in this connexion being that of
Sir Josiah Mason. Electro-plating, first established in 1841 by
the firm of Elkington, is one of the leading trades. Among other
branches of manufacture are wire-drawing, bell founding,
metal rolling, railway-carriage building (a large and important
industry), the manufacture of cutting implements and tools of
all kinds, die-sinking, papier-maché making and a variety of
others. In 1897 there was a sudden development of cycle manufacturing,
followed in 1899 by an almost equally sudden collapse,
but this industry is maintained and accompanied by the manufacture
of motor cars, tyres and accessories, for which Birmingham
is one of the principal centres in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Birmingham may claim as her own the perfection of the steam
engine, through the genius of James Watt and the courage of
Matthew Boulton. The memory of the great Soho factory is one
of the most precious heritages of the town, and Watt&rsquo;s own
private workshop continues just as he left it, with no single
article disturbed, carefully preserved in the garret of his house at
Heathfield. The mention of Watt and of Soho recalls the memories
of distinguished inventors and others who have been connected
with Birmingham. Here John Baskerville, the printer, carried
on his work. An institution called the Lunar Society, which
met each month about the time of full moon, brought together
a brilliant company&mdash;Watt, Boulton, Joseph Priestley, Josiah
Wedgwood, Erasmus Darwin, Samuel Parr, Dr William Withering,
Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Sir Joseph Banks, Sir William
Herschel, Dr Solander, John Roebuck, James Keir and many
others. William Murdock, the inventor of gas, was a Soho man,
and first used his invention to light the Soho factory at the
peace of Amiens in 1802. The series of inventors is continued by
the names of Gillott, Elkington, Chance, Mason and others.
Thomas Rickman, the reviver and historian of Gothic architecture,
practised as an architect in Birmingham. William Hutton,
the antiquary and historian, carried on his bookselling business
here. Many of the best engravers were Birmingham men,
notably James Tibbitts Willmore and John Pye, the special
translators of Turner&rsquo;s marvellous creations. Attwood, Joseph
Parkes, John Bright and Joseph Chamberlain speak for Birmingham
in the region of politics and statesmanship.</p>

<p>One of the most marked features of social life in Birmingham
is the fact that contrasts in the distribution of wealth are less
strongly marked than in most other great cities. The distance
between the poorest and the richest is bridged over by a larger
number of intermediate gradations. Colossal fortunes are few;
on the other hand there is a numerous class of rich men. These,
however, for the greater part are actually engaged in trade or
manufactures, and hold their place in local life rather on account
of industry pursued than of wealth possessed. The number of
the leisured class, enjoying large incomes without participating
in any local industry, is relatively small, but is said to be on the
increase. There are many manufacturing companies, but great
private firms are also numerous. In regard to labour conditions,
the system of small masters holds its own in the manufactures
of Birmingham, and shows no signs of extinction. One
effect of this condition is that capital and labour are not
brought into enmity, and consequently strikes and disputes are
infrequent. As regards the condition of the working classes it
may be noted that Birmingham was the birthplace of the freehold
land and building societies, by which workmen are enabled on
easy terms to acquire houses of their own. The risk of an
overcrowded population is consequently minimized; the houses,
moreover, are generally well situated as regards light and air,
and many have small gardens. Among industrial communities
where peculiar attention is paid to the housing of workmen and
their families, that of Bourneville, occupied by the <i>employés</i> of
Messrs Cadbury, chocolate manufacturers, is well known.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Owing to its rapid expansion, and the consequent
newness of most of the public and other buildings, Birmingham
is often supposed to be a modern town. It was, however, in
existence as a community in the Saxon period. Proof of this
was given in 1309 by William de Bermingham, then lord of the
manor, who showed in a law-suit that his ancestors had a market
in the place and levied tolls before the Conquest. Some authors
have endeavoured to identify the town with the supposed Roman
station called Bremenium, but this claim has long been
abandoned as fabulous. A Roman road runs north and south
across the site of the town, but no remains have been found other
than a very few coins. The origin of the name is untraceable;
the spelling itself has passed through about 100 different forms.
Dugdale, the historian of Warwickshire, adopts Bromwycham,
and regards it as of Saxon derivation. Hutton, the historian of
Birmingham, has the fanciful etymology of <i>Brom</i> (broom),
<i>wych</i> (a descent), and <i>ham</i> (a home), making together the home
on the hill by the heath.</p>

<p>In <i>Domesday Book</i> Birmingham is rated at four miles of land
with half a mile of woods, the whole valued at £203. Two
hundred years later the family of de Bermingham, the owners of
the place, come into sight, one of them, William, being killed at
the battle of Evesham, in 1265, fighting with Simon de Montfort
and the barons against Henry III. The son of this William
afterwards took part in the French war, and was made prisoner;
his father&rsquo;s estates, forfeited by treason, were restored to him.
Thenceforward the family engaged in various local and other
offices, but seemingly abstained from politics. They held the
place until 1527, when Edward de Bermingham was deprived of
his property by means of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland,
who trumped up a pretended charge of riot and robbery against
him and procured Birmingham for himself. On the attainder
of Dudley the manor passed to the crown, and was granted to
Thomas Marrow, of Berkswell, from whom by marriage and
descent it went to Christopher Musgrave, and finally, as regards
the only valuable part&mdash;the market tolls&mdash;by purchase to the
town itself. In the Wars of the Roses it does not seem that
Birmingham took any part; but energy revived in the Civil
War under Charles I., when the town sided actively with the
Parliamentarians. In 1642, when Charles was marching from
Shrewsbury to relieve Banbury, the Birmingham people seized
part of his baggage, including much plate, money and wine,
which they sent to the Parliamentary garrison at Warwick.
Before the battle of Edgehill Charles rested for two nights at
Aston Hall, near the town, as the guest of Sir Thomas Holte.
The Birmingham people resented this by helping the Parliamentarians
to cannonade the Hall and to levy a fine upon Sir
Thomas Holte. They also supplied the Parliamentary army
with 15,000 sword blades, refusing to make a single blade for
the Royalists. These manifestations of hostility were avenged
in April 1643 by Prince Rupert, who, with 2000 men and several
pieces of artillery, attacked the town, planting his cannon on an
eminence near Sparkbrook, still known as Camphill. The townspeople
resisted, but were beaten, many persons being killed or
wounded. Amongst the former was Lord Denbigh, one of the
Royalist officers. Having captured the place, Prince Rupert
allowed his troops to plunder it, to burn about eighty houses and
to set their prisoners to ransom. He also levied a fine of £30,000,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page988" id="page988"></a>988</span>
equal to at least £100,000 of the present value of money. This
bitter lesson kept Birmingham quiet during the rest of the Civil
War, though the sympathies of the people with the Parliamentarians
were unabated. In 1665 Birmingham suffered heavy
losses by the plague, great numbers of dead being buried in the
Pest Field, at Ladywood, then a lonely place far outside the
town, but long since thickly covered with buildings. In 1688
the Revolution provoked a temporary outbreak of Protestant
feeling. James II. had given timber from the royal forest of
Needwood, near Burton, to build a Roman Catholic chapel and
convent in a place still called Mass-house Lane. This edifice the
mob promptly destroyed when James gave place to William and
Mary. Rather more than a century of quiet prosperity ensued,
and then occurred the serious and most lamentable outbreak
of popular fury known as the Church and King riots of 1791.
For some years there had been much political activity in Birmingham,
the dissenters, particularly the Unitarians, being
desirous of relief from the political and religious disabilities under
which they laboured. The leader in these movements was the
famous Dr Priestley, who kept up an active controversy with the
local clergy and others, and thus drew upon himself and his
co-religionists the hatred of the more violent members of the
Church and Tory party. The smouldering fire broke out on the
occasion of the French Revolution. On the 14th of July a dinner
of Birmingham Liberals was held at the Royal hotel to celebrate
the destruction of the Bastille. This was the signal of a popular
outbreak. A Church and King mob, encouraged and organized
by leaders of better station, who were too cowardly to show
themselves, began an attack upon the Unitarians. Priestley
was not present at the dinner, but his house at Fair Hill, Sparkbrook,
was one of the first to be sacked and burnt&mdash;his library
and laboratory, with all his manuscripts, the records of lifelong
scientific and philosophical inquiries, perishing in the flames.
The house and library of Hutton the historian were also
destroyed. The Unitarian chapel was burnt, and several houses
belonging to members of the sect were sacked and burnt. The
riot continued until a strong body of troops was marched into
the town, but before their arrival damage to the amount of more
than £60,000 had been done. Some of the rioters perished in the
burning buildings, in the cellars of which they drank themselves
into stupefaction. Others were tried and imprisoned, and four
of the prisoners were hanged. The persecuted Unitarians
recovered a small part of their losses from the county; but
Priestley himself, owing in a great measure to the unworthy
prejudice against him, was forced to remove to the United States
of America, where he spent the rest of his life. A late atonement
was made by the town to his memory in 1873, by the erection
of a statue in his honour in front of the town hall and the
foundation of a Priestley scholarship at the Midland Institute.</p>

<p>As if ashamed of the excesses of 1791, Birmingham thenceforth
became, with one or two exceptions, a peaceful town. In the
dismal period from 1817 to 1819, when the manufacturing
districts were heavily distressed and were disturbed by riots,
Birmingham remained quiet. Even when some of the inhabitants
were tried and punished for demanding parliamentary representation,
and for electing Sir Charles Wolseley as their delegate,
there was no demonstration of violence&mdash;the wise counsels of
the leaders inducing orderly submission to the law. The same
prudent course was observed when in the Reform agitation of
1831-1832 the Political Union was formed, under the leadership
of Thomas Attwood, to promote the passing of the Reform Bill.
Almost the whole town, and great part of the surrounding
district, joined in this agitation; vast meetings were held on
Newhall Hill; there was much talk of marching upon London
100,000 strong; but, owing to the firmness and statesmanship
of Attwood and his associates, there was no rioting or any sign
of violence. Ultimately the Political Union succeeded in its
object, and Birmingham helped to secure for the nation the
enfranchisement of the middle classes and other political reforms.
One exception to the tranquillity of the town has to be recorded&mdash;the
occurrence of riots in 1839, during the Chartist agitation.
Chartism took a strong hold in Birmingham, and, under the
influence of Feargus O&rsquo;Connor and some of his associates, nightly
meetings of a threatening character were held in the Bull Ring.
The magistrates resolved to put these down, and having obtained
the help of a detachment of the metropolitan police&mdash;the town
then having no local police force&mdash;a meeting was dispersed, and
a riot ensued, which resulted in injury to several persons and
required military force to suppress it. This happened on the
4th of July. On the 15th of the same month another meeting
took place, and the mob, strongly armed and numbering many
thousands, set fire to several houses in the Bull Ring, some of
which were burned to the ground and others were greatly
damaged. The military again interfered, and order was restored,
several of the ringleaders being afterwards tried and imprisoned
for their share in the disturbance. There was another riot in
1867, caused by the ferocious attacks of a lecturer named
Murphy upon the Roman Catholics, which led to the sacking of
a street chiefly inhabited by Irishmen; but the incident was
comparatively trivial and further disorders were prevented by
the prompt action of the authorities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRNEY, JAMES GILLESPIE<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> (1792-1857), American reformer,
leader of the conservative abolitionists in the United States from
about 1835 to 1845, was born in Danville, Kentucky, of a family
of wealth and influence, on the 4th of February 1792. He
graduated at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University)
in 1810. In 1814, after a course of legal study, he began
the practice of the law at Danville. He entered immediately, as
a Democrat, into Kentucky politics, and political ambition caused
his removal in 1818 to northern Alabama, near Huntsville.
There was at that time in the south-west much anti-slavery
sentiment. Birney&rsquo;s father was among those who advocated a
&ldquo;free state&rdquo; constitution for Kentucky, and the home environment
of the boy had thus fostered a questioning attitude towards
slavery, though later he was himself a slave-holder. In the
general assembly of Kentucky in 1816, and in that of Alabama
in 1819, he opposed inter-state rendition of fugitive slaves and
championed liberal slave-laws. His career as a lawyer in
Alabama was exceptionally brilliant; but his political career
was abruptly wrecked by his opposition in 1819 to Andrew
Jackson, whose friends controlled the state. His tariff and anti-slavery
views, moreover, carried him more and more away from
the Democratic party and toward the Whigs.</p>

<p>About 1826 he began to show an active interest in the American
Colonization Society, and in 1832-1833 served as its agent in the
south-west. In 1833 he returned to Danville, and devoted
himself wholly to the anti-slavery cause. He freed his own
slaves in 1834. Convinced that gradual emancipation would
merely stimulate the inter-state slave trade, and that the dangers
of a mixed labour system were greater than those of emancipation
in mass, he formally repudiated colonization in 1834;
moreover, gradualism had become for him an unjustifiable
compromise in a matter of religion and justice. At this time
also he abandoned the Whig party. He delivered anti-slavery
addresses in the North, accepted the vice-presidency of the
American Anti-Slavery Society and announced his intention to
establish an anti-slavery journal at Danville (1835). For this he
was ostracized from Kentucky society; his anti-slavery journals
were withheld in the mails; he could not secure a public hall or
a printer. In these circumstances, he removed to Cincinnati,
Ohio, and there, in January 1836, founded the <i>Philanthropist</i>,
which, in spite of rancorous opposition, became of great influence
in the north-west. Birney soon relinquished its active control in
order to serve the Anti-Slavery Society as secretary and as a
lecturer. He favoured immediatism, but he differed sharply
from the Garrisonian abolitionists, who abhorred the federal
Constitution and favoured secession. He always wrote, spoke
and laboured for the permanent safety of the Union. The
assaults of the South in defence of slavery upon free speech, free
press, the right of petition and trial by jury, he pronounced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page989" id="page989"></a>989</span>
&ldquo;exorbitant claims ... on the liberties of the free states&rdquo;;
the contest had become, he said, &ldquo;one not alone of freedom for
the blacks but of freedom for the whites.&rdquo; Twenty-three years
before William H. Seward characterized as an &ldquo;irrepressible
conflict&rdquo; the antagonism between freedom and slavery, Birney
proclaimed: &ldquo;There will be no cessation of conflict until slavery
shall be exterminated or liberty destroyed&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;liberty and
slavery cannot both live in juxtaposition&rdquo; (1835). The ends
being political, so also, thought Birney, must be the means; as
parties in the south were fusing, he laboured to re-align parties in
the north, and advocated the formation of an independent anti-slavery
party. After the separation of the Garrisonian and the
political abolitionists in 1840 the new party was formed, and in
1840, and again in 1844, as the Liberty party (<i>q.v.</i>), it made
Birney its candidate for the presidency. In 1840 he received
7069 votes; in 1844, 62,263. A fall from his horse in 1843 made
him a hopeless invalid, and completely removed him from public
life. He died at Perth Amboy, New Jersey, on the 25th of
November 1857.</p>

<p>Two of Birney&rsquo;s sons, William Birney (1810-1907) and David
Bell Birney (1825-1864), were prominent as officers on the
Federal side during the Civil War in America.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRON, ARMAND DE GONTAUT,<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron de</span> (1524-1592),
a celebrated French soldier of the 16th century. His family, one
of the numerous branches of the house of Gontaut, took its title
from the territory of Biron in Perigord, where on a hill between the
Dropt and the Lide still stands the magnificent castle begun by
the lords of Biron in the 11th century. As a page of the queen
of Navarre Biron attracted the notice of the marshal de Brissac,
with whom he saw active service in Italy. A wound received by
him in his early years made him lame for life, but he did not
withdraw from the military career, and he held a command in
Guise&rsquo;s regiment of light horse in 1557. A little later he became
chief of a cavalry regiment, and in the wars of religion he
repeatedly distinguished himself.</p>

<p>His great services to the royal cause at Dreux, St Denis, Jarnac
and Moncontour were rewarded in 1569 by his appointment as
a privy councillor of the king and grand master of artillery.
He commanded the royal forces at the siege of La Rochelle
in 1572, and four years later was made a marshal of France.
From 1576 to 1588 he was almost continuously employed in high
command. From 1589 he supported the cause of Henry of
Navarre, but was suspected of prolonging the civil wars in his
own interest. Biron was killed by a cannon-ball at the siege of
Epernay on the 26th of July 1592. He was a man of considerable
literary attainments, and used to carry a pocket-book, in which
he noted everything that appeared remarkable. Some of his
letters are preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale and in the
British Museum; these include a treatise on the art of war.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Charles de Gontaut</span>, duc de Biron (1562-1602),
fought brilliantly for the royal party against the League. He
was made admiral of France in 1592, and marshal in 1594;
governor of Burgundy in 1595, he took the towns of Beaune,
Autun, Auxonne and Dijon, and distinguished himself at the
battle of Fontaine-Francaise. In 1596 he was sent to fight the
Spaniards in Flanders, Picardy and Artois. After the peace of
Vervins he discharged a mission at Brussels (1598). From that
time he was engaged in intrigues with Spain and Savoy, and,
notwithstanding, directed the expedition sent against the duke
of Savoy (1599-1600). After fulfilling diplomatic missions for
Henry IV. in England and Switzerland (1600), he was accused
and convicted of high treason and was beheaded in the Bastille
on the 31st of July 1602.</p>

<p>His collateral descendant, <span class="sc">Armand Louis de Gontaut</span>, due de
Lauzun, afterwards duc de Biron (1747-1793), is known for the
part he played in the War of American Independence and the
revolutionary wars. Until 1788, when he succeeded to the duchy
of Biron on the death of his uncle,&mdash;Louis Antoine de Gontaut,
duc de Biron (1700-1788)&mdash;he bore the title of duc de Lauzun,
which had passed, on the death of Antoine Nompas de Caumont,
duc de Lauzun (1633-1723), to his niece, the wife of Charles
Armand de Gontaut, duc de Biron (1663-1756). After for a
while wasting his fortune in dissipation in various parts of Europe,
he attracted attention by an essay on the military defences of
Great Britain and her colonies (<i>État de défense d&rsquo;Angleterre et de
toutes ses possessions dans les quatres parties du monde</i>). This led
to his appointment to a command against the English in 1779,
in which he gained several successes. In the following year he
took a conspicuous part in the War of American Independence,
and on his return to France was made <i>maréchal de camp</i>. In 1789
he was returned as deputy to the states-general by the <i>noblesse</i> of
Quercy, and attached himself to the revolutionary cause. In
1791 he was sent by the Constituent Assembly to receive the oath
of the army of Flanders, and subsequently was appointed to its
command. In July 1792 he was nominated commander of the
army of the Rhine, with the duty of watching the movements of
the Austrians. In May 1793 he was transferred to the command
of the army of La Rochelle, operating against the insurgents of
La Vendée. He gained several successes, among them the
capture of Saumur and the victory of Parthenay; but the
insubordination of his troops and the intrigues of revolutionary
agents made his position intolerable and he sent in his resignation.
He was thereupon accused by the notorious Carrier of <i>incivisme</i>
and undue leniency to the insurgents, deprived of his command
(July), imprisoned in the Abbaye and condemned to death by the
Revolutionary Tribunal. He was guillotined on the 31st of
December 1793. Some <i>Mémoires</i>, which come down to 1783, were
published under his name in 1822 (new ed. 1858), and in 1865
letters said to have been written by him in 1789 to friends in the
country, describing the states-general.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRR,<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Parsonstown</span>, a market-town of King&rsquo;s county,
Ireland, on an acclivity rising above the Birr, and on a branch of
the Great Southern &amp; Western railway by which it is 87 m.
W.S.W. from Dublin. Pop. of urban district (1901) 4438.
Cumberland Square, in which there is a Doric column surmounted
by a statue of the duke of Cumberland, to commemorate the
battle of Culloden, is the point from which the several principal
streets diverge in regular form. The fine castle of Birr, beside
its historical interest, has gained celebrity on account of the
reflecting telescope erected here (1828-1845) by William, third
earl of Rosse. This is 56 ft. in length and weighs 3 tons; and
there is another smaller instrument. Among institutions the
model and preparatory schools of the Brothers of the Presentation
Order are noteworthy. There is a bronze statue by Foley of
Lord Rosse (d. 1867). Some trade is carried on in corn and
timber, and in brewing and distilling.</p>

<p>An abbey was founded at Birr by St Brendan (d. 573), to whom
the present parish church is dedicated. The district formed part
of Ely O&rsquo;Carroll, and was not included in King&rsquo;s county till the
time of James I. A great battle is said to have been fought near
Birr in the 3rd century between Cormac, son of Cond of the
Hundred Battles, and the people of Münster. The castle was
the chief seat of the O&rsquo;Carrolls. In the reign of James I. it and
its appendages were assigned to Lawrence Parsons, brother of
Sir William Parsons, surveyor-general. From him the alternative
name of the town is derived. The castle was more than once
besieged in the time of Cromwell, and was taken by Ireton in
1650. It also suffered assault in 1688 and 1690.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRRELL, AUGUSTINE<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (1850-&emsp;&emsp;), English author and
politician, son of a Nonconformist minister, was born near
Liverpool on the 19th of January 1850. He was educated at
Amersham Hall school and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He
went to the bar, and gradually obtained a good practice; in 1893
he became a K.C., and he was professor of law at University
College from 1896 to 1899. But it was as a literary critic of
unusually clever style and an original vein of wit, that he first
became known to the public, with his volume of essays entitled
<i>Obiter Dicta</i> (1884). In 1889 he was returned to parliament for
West Fifeshire as a Liberal. In the House of Commons his light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page990" id="page990"></a>990</span>
but pointed humour gradually led to the coining of a new word,
&ldquo;barrelling,&rdquo; and his literary and oratorical reputation grew apace.
Whether he was writing miscellaneous essays or law-books, his
characteristic style prevailed, and his books on copyright and
on trusts were novelties indeed among legal textbooks, no less
sparkling than his literary <i>Obiter Dicta</i>. A second series of the
latter appeared in 1887. <i>Res Judicatae</i> in 1892 and various
other volumes followed, for he was in request among publishers
and editors, and his easy charm of style and acute grasp of
interesting detail gave him a front place among contemporary
men of letters. Mr Birrell was first married in 1878, but his wife
died next year, and in 1888 he married Mrs Lionel Tennyson,
daughter of the poet Frederick Locker (Locker-Lampson). At
the general election of 1900 he preferred to contest the N.E.
division of Manchester rather than retain his seat in Fifeshire,
but was defeated. He did valuable service, however, to his party
by presiding over the Liberal Publication Department, and at the
general election of 1906 he was returned for a division of Bristol.
He had been included in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&rsquo;s
cabinet, and as minister for education he was responsible for the
education bill which was the chief government measure in their
first session. But the prolonged controversy over the bill, and
its withdrawal in the autumn owing to the refusal of the government
to accept modifications made by the House of Lords in
the denominational interest, made his retention of that office
impossible, and he was transferred (January 1907) to the post of
chief secretary for Ireland, which he subsequently retained when
Mr Asquith became prime minister in 1908. In the session of 1907
he introduced an Irish Councils bill, a sort of half-way house to
Home Rule; but it was unexpectedly repudiated by a Nationalist
convention in Dublin and the bill was promptly withdrawn.
His prestige as a minister, already injured by these two blows,
suffered further during the autumn and winter from the cattle-driving
agitation in Ireland, which he at first feebly criticized
and finally strongly denounced, but which his refusal to utilize
the Crimes Act made him powerless to stop by the processes of
the &ldquo;ordinary law&rdquo;; and the scandal arising out of the theft
of the Dublin crown jewels in the autumn of 1907 was a further
blot on the Irish administration. On the other hand his scheme
for a reconstituted Irish Roman Catholic university was very
favourably received, and its acceptance in 1908 did much to
restore his reputation for statesmanship.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BIRTH<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> (a word common in various forms to Teutonic languages
from the root of the verb &ldquo;to bear&rdquo;), the act of bringing forth
a child, or the fact of its being born; so also a synonym for descent
or lineage. In law, a child not actually born, but <i>en ventre
sa mère</i>, is supposed for many purposes to be actually born, and
may take any benefit to which it would have been entitled if
actually born, <i>i.e.</i> it may take as legatee or devisee, or even as
next-of-kin or heir, but none of these conditions will take effect,
unless the child is born alive (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Medical Jurisprudence</a></span>).
The given year of age of a child is gained at the first instant of the
day preceding the birthday, and no account is taken of parts of
a day, <i>e.g.</i> a child born at 11.59 on the night of the 2nd-3rd of

the Person Act of 1861, it is a misdemeanour punishable by a
maximum of two years&rsquo; imprisonment with hard labour, to endeavour
to conceal the birth of a child by any secret disposition of its
dead body, whether the child died before, after or at its birth.</p>

<p><i>Registration of Births.</i>&mdash;The registration of baptisms is said to
have been first introduced by Thomas Cromwell when vicar-general
in 1538, but it is only in comparatively modern times
that registration has been fully carried out. The law relating
to the registration of births was consolidated for England by the
Births and Deaths Registration Act 1874, and for Ireland by the
Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland) 1880. In Scotland
it depends upon the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages
(Scotland) Act 1854, as amended by later acts. Previously to
the passing of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836, the
records of the births were compiled from parish registers, which
were formerly a part of the ecclesiastical organization, and
continued to be attached, more or less, to the church till the passing
of the act of 1836. That act provided a far more complete
machinery than that before existing for the exact record of all
births. The new system relieved the clergy from all functions
previously thrown upon them, and finally, after improvement
by subsequent acts, was made compulsory in 1874. The act
of 1836 established a general register office in London, presided
over by an officer called the registrar-general, with general
superintendence over everything relating to registration. The
registrar-general is appointed under the Great Seal. Every poor-law
union or parish is divided into districts, each of which is
called by a distinct name, and is in charge of a registrar, who is
a local officer appointed by the guardians of the union. Over
each union is a superintendent registrar, who has supervision
over the registrars within his district. The office of superintendent
registrar is usually filled by the clerk to the guardians of
the union. He receives quarterly from every registrar within his
district certified copies of the births registered by him and having
verified their correctness, transmits them to the registrar-general.
He takes charge of the register-books within the district, when
filled. Every registrar is required to inform himself carefully
of every birth which happens within his sub-district and register
the same, with the various particulars required, according to
the forms laid down for the purpose. It is the duty of the father
or mother of any child born alive, or in their default, then of
the occupier of the house (if he knows of the birth) or of any
person present at the birth or having charge of the child, to
give to the registrars, within forty-two days after the day of
the birth, information of the particulars required to be registered
concerning the birth, and in the presence of the registrar to sign
the register. Every person required to give information concerning
any birth who wilfully refuses to answer questions put
to him by the registrar concerning the particulars required
to be registered, or who refuses or fails without reasonable
excuse to give information of any birth, becomes liable to a
penalty of forty shillings. After three months a birth can only
be registered in the presence of the superintendent registrar,
and after the expiration of twelve months a birth can only be
registered with the written authority of the registrar-general.
In the case of an illegitimate child, no person as the father of
such child is required to give information, nor is the name of
any one entered in the register as the father of such a child,
unless at the joint request of the mother and the person who
acknowledges himself to be the father. An additional duty
is placed upon the father by the Notification of Births Act 1907.
By that act it is the duty of the father of a child if he is actually
residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of
its occurrence to give notice in writing of the birth to the medical
officer of health of the district in which the child is born within
thirty-six hours of the birth. The same duty is also imposed
upon any person in attendance (<i>i.e.</i> medical practitioner or
midwife) upon the mother at the time of or within six hours
after the birth. The medical officer of health is then in a position
to take such steps, by advice or otherwise, as may, in his
opinion lead to the prevention of infant mortality. Notice
under the act is given by posting a prepaid letter or postcard
to the medical officer of health giving the necessary information.
Failure to give notice entails on summary conviction a penalty
not exceeding twenty shillings. The act is optional to local
authorities, but may be enforced within any area by the Local
Government Board. By the Births and Deaths Registration
Act 1874 and the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, commanding
officers of ships trading to or from British ports must, under a
penalty, transmit returns of all births occurring on board their
ships to the registrar-general of shipping, who furnishes certified
copies of such returns to the registrars-general for England,
Scotland and Ireland. These returns of births (and deaths)
constitute the &ldquo;Marine Register Book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Registration is very efficiently carried out in practically every
European country, with the exceptions of Turkey and Russia.
In the United States laws requiring registration vary in the
different states.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page991" id="page991"></a>991</span></p>

<p><i>Tax on Birth.</i>&mdash;In 1694 an act was passed in England for
&ldquo;granting to His Majesty certain rates and duties upon marriages,
births and burials, upon bachelors and widowers for the term of
five years, for carrying on the war against France with vigour.&rdquo;
The taxes were graduated, rising from four shillings on the burial
of the humblest person to £50 in the case of a duke or duchess.
The duty on births varied according to the rank of the parents.
A duke paid £30 on the birth of an eldest son, and £25 for every
other child; a baronet or knight, £5 for an eldest son, and £1
each for other children. An archbishop or bishop, or a doctor
of divinity, law or physic paid £1 for every child; a gentleman
having a personal estate of £600 or a real estate worth £50 per
annum, paid ten shillings on the birth of each child. Every
other person not receiving alms paid a tax of two shillings on
the birth of each child. This measure, however, was only
temporary, and passed for revenue purposes solely.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BISALTAE,<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> a Thracian people on the lower Strymon (Struma;
Karasu, &ldquo;black water&rdquo;), in the district between Amphipolis and
Heraclea Sintica on the east and Crestonice on the west. They
also made their way into the peninsulas of Acte and Pallene in
the south, beyond the river Nestus in the east, and are even said
to have raided Cardia. Under a separate king at the time of the
Persian wars, they were annexed by Alexander I. (498-454 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
to the kingdom of Macedonia. At the division of Macedonia
into four districts by the Romans after the battle of Pydna (168)
the Bisaltae were included in Macedonia Prima (Livy xlv. 29).</p>

<p>Their country was rich in figs, vines and olive trees; the
silver mines in the mountain range of Dysorum brought in a
talent a day to their conqueror Alexander. The Bisaltae are
referred to by Virgil (<i>Georgics</i>, iii. 461) in connexion with the
treatment of the diseases of sheep. The fact that their eponymus
is said to have been the son of Helios and Ge points to a very
early settlement in the district.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BISCAY<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (<i>Vizcaya</i>), a maritime province of northern Spain;
bounded on the N. by the Bay of Biscay, E. by Guipúzcoa, S. by
Álava and W. by Burgos and Santander. Pop. (1900) 311,361;
area, 836 sq. m. A small strip of isolated territory within the
borders of Biscay, on the west, is officially included in the
province of Santander. Biscay is one of the Basque Provinces,
and its name is occasionally employed as geographically equivalent
to Basque, in that case including the three provinces of Biscay
proper, Guipúzcoa and Álava. The coast-line, which extends
from Ondarroa to a short distance east of Castro Urdiales, is bold
and rugged, and in some places is deeply indented. The surface
of the country is for the most part very mountainous, being
traversed towards the south by the great Cantabrian chain; but
at the same time it is diversified with numerous narrow valleys
and small plains. Some of the mountains are almost entirely
composed of naked calcareous rock, but most of them were
formerly covered to their summits with forests of oaks, chestnuts
or pine trees, now destroyed to provide fuel. Holly and arbutus
are common, and furze and heath abound in the poorer parts.
The only river of any size is the Nervion, Ansa or Ibaizabal, on
which Bilbao is situated; the others, which are numerous, are
merely large mountain streams. The climate is rather inclement
and variable; but the thermometer seldom drops below freezing-point,
nor does snow fall frequently in winter except on the
highest summits. The rainfall is on an average greater than in
any province except those of the extreme north-west. The soil,
though not very fertile, except in some of the valleys and sheltered
hillsides, produces wheat, maize, barley, rye, flax, grapes, peaches,
apples and other fruits. The mountainous slopes of Biscay are
studded with the traditional Basque <i>caserio</i>, or farm-house, in
which the peasantry live on the <i>métayer</i> system, dividing the
profits of the soil with absentee landlords. The farms are
generally small, and are for the most part tilled by manual
labour. The fisheries are actively prosecuted along the coast by a
hardy race of fishers, who were the first of their craft in Europe
to pursue the whale, formerly abundant in the Bay of Biscay.
Cod, bream, tunny and anchovy are the principal fish taken.
The fishing fleet consists of several hundred boats, manned by
nearly 5000 men and boys. Biscay is very rich in minerals.
Iron of the finest quality is found in almost every part, and
forms a main article of export. At the beginning of the 20th
century an average of about 5,000,000 tons was produced every
year, and many large foundries were at work. Lead and zinc are
mined in much smaller quantities, alum and sulphur are also
present, and marble, lime and sandstone are abundant. Another
very important industry is the manufacture of dynamite and
other explosives at Baracaldo, closely connected with the
mining interests. There are also potteries, paper, soap and shoe
factories, flour mills and breweries, and the many mineral springs
and spas are frequented by people from all parts of Spain. The
mining and industrial interests of Biscay were very materially
assisted by the quick and important development of means of
communication of every kind. The provincial and parish roads,
kept up by the local government, are excellent. No province in
Spain had at the beginning of the 20th century such a complete
network of railways, all built since 1870.</p>

<p>Bilbao (pop. 83,306), the capital and principal port, and
Baracaldo (15,013), an important industrial town, are described
in separate articles. Sestao (10,833) is the only other town of
more than 10,000 inhabitants; the port of Bermeo (9061) is the
chief fishing station; Durango (4319), on the river of the same
name, was founded by the early kings of Navarre in the 10th
century, obtained the rank of a countship in 1153, and contains
one of the oldest churches in the Basque Provinces, San Pedro
de Tavira; Guernica (3250), a picturesque village on the river
Mondaca, was until 1876 the meeting-place of the provincial
parliament. The deputies assembled under an old oak-tree,
celebrated by the Basque poet, José Maria Iparraguirre, in a
song which is regarded by the Spanish Basques almost as a
national anthem. For the history of the Basques, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Basque
Provinces</a></span>; for their origin, language and customs, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Basques</a></span>.
The inhabitants of Biscay are intelligent, enterprising and
well-educated; and, owing to the uniformly high birth-rate, low
death-rate, and very slight loss by emigration, their numbers
increased rapidly during the latter part of the 19th century, until
in 1900 the density of population (372.4 per sq. m.) was greater
than in any other Spanish province.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BISCAY, BAY OF<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (Fr. <i>Golfe de Gascogne</i>; Sp. <i>Golfo de
Vizcaya</i>), an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean; bounded on the E. and
N.E. by France, as far as the island of Ushant, and on the S. by
Spain as far as Cape Ortegal. The Bay of Biscay is the <i>Sinus
Aquitanicus</i>, <i>Sinus Cantabricus</i> or <i>Cantaber Oceanus</i> of the
Romans; hence it is sometimes known as the Cantabrian Sea.
Its modern English name is a corrupt form of the Spanish <i>Vizcaya</i>.
The bay forms a fairly regular curve, broken on the French seaboard
only by the estuaries of the Loire, Garonne, Adour and
other rivers. The rugged Spanish coast is indented by many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page992" id="page992"></a>992</span>
fjord-like inlets, especially in the west, where navigation is sometimes
difficult and dangerous; but its rivers are comparatively
unimportant. The exposed position of the bay, and the diversity
of its currents, have rendered it notorious for its storms.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BISCUIT<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (pronounced according to the old spelling &ldquo;bisket,&rdquo;
a Fr. form from Lat. <i>bis</i>, twice, and <i>coctum</i>, cooked, in reference
to the original method of preparation; cf. Ital. <i>biscotto</i>, Sp.
<i>bizcocho</i>, &amp;c.), a form of unvesiculated bread (<i>q.v</i>.) which is
made in thin cakes of various shapes and baked in such a way
as to be crisp and short. In the United States of America
biscuits of this kind are usually called crackers, but the word
biscuit is used there, as also in the north of England, for vesiculated
bread baked in little flat loaves or cakes. Earthenware,
porcelain, &amp;c., which has undergone its first baking and is ready
to be glazed is also known as biscuit or bisque.</p>

<p>The raw material chiefly used in biscuit manufacture is flour,
but many other substances, such as butter, sugar, salt, various
flavouring essences, &amp;c., are also employed. The flour used by
the biscuit-maker differs somewhat from that preferred by the
bread-baker. In the main the bread-baker wants flour of some
strength, that is to say, flour capable of absorbing a considerable
proportion of water and of making a loaf of more or less volume.
For biscuits flour strength is not such a desideratum, and as
a matter of fact such moisture as is used to make the dough is
largely evaporated by the oven; but, except for the commoner
kind of biscuits, colour is most essential, as well as sweetness
of flavour. In a large biscuit factory several hundred different
kinds of biscuits are made, ranging from plain water biscuits
to the daintiest fancy biscuits glistening in sugar and piping.
The storage required for such an establishment is extensive,
but lifts serve to handle both raw material and finished products
with a minimum of labour. The flour used by a firm which has
a reputation to maintain is sifted as a precaution against the
presence of bits of string or other foreign bodies which will
make their way into flour sacked by the most careful of millers,
and like the butter, sugar and other raw materials, is carefully
inspected and tested before being accepted. After blending it
is run through a shoot or sleeve to the mixers, which may be
of any type used in bakehouses (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bread</a></span>). From the mixers
or kneaders the dough is delivered on a flat table, or it may go
direct to a pair of rolls. These consist of iron rollers with a
reversing motion, between which the dough is rolled backwards
and forwards into sheets of uniform thickness. The next stage
is the feeding of portions of this slab of dough to a cutting and
panning machine. In details this apparatus differs as supplied
by different makers, but the broad principle is the same in
every case. The dough, after first passing through a pair of
gauging rollers, which still further thin out the sheet and are
capable of regulating its thickness with the utmost nicety, is
received by an endless conveyor-band of webbing or similar
material. By this band it is carried forward by intermittent
motion to a set of punches or stamps which descend on it in
quick succession, and serve to mould the surface and cut the
edges to the required pattern. This operation completed, the
moulded dough passes forward on the same endless band.
The dough has now been cut into two distinct divisions, the
moulded biscuits and the unworked portion which forms a
continuous sheet of a sort of scrap. The latter is separated from
the moulded dough, and is carried upwards by another band,
which delivers it on a tray or box whence it is returned to the
rollers to be reworked. The moulded dough intended for the
oven is carried along by the first band and is gently deposited
on trays of sheet iron or woven wire. These trays are taken from
the machine by boys and placed on the travelling-chains at the
oven, or the trays may be automatically moved forward by a
travelling-band and placed on the oven. The oven used for
biscuit-baking is quite unlike any bread oven. It is much
longer and is provided with sets of endless chains moving in
parallel lines, and travelling over sprocket-wheel terminals and
intermediate supports. The chains have special attachments
on which the trays of biscuits are rested, and thus pass them
through the oven, and discharge them at the opposite end.
Some ovens are provided with a sort of endless belt of iron plates
on which the biscuits are placed. These travelling bands are
used chiefly for ship and also for dog biscuits, but the most
usual type is the oven in which trays are moved on the travelling
chains already described. The exact rate of travel, or the time
during which the biscuits are in the oven, can be easily adjusted
by means of countershafts and leather belts running on cone
pulleys fitted at the discharging end. The heat of the oven as
well as the rate of travel is varied according to the kind of biscuit,
some varieties requiring a gentle heat and a comparatively long
sojourn in the oven, while others must be exposed to a fierce heat,
but only for a few minutes. The ovens, fired by coke, may be 38 to
50 ft. in length. Their temperature is not generally raised above
500 degrees, but the speed of travel of the trays ranges between
3½ and 25 minutes. The whole process of biscuit-making is
thus rapid and continuous. The dough is kneaded in the mixers
in a few minutes, and when discharged on the dough table is
rapidly moulded into the required form by the cutter and panner.
By means of endless bands the material is kept moving forwards,
whether on the cutter, or in the oven. For certain fancy biscuits
special processes are used. Piping and sugar decoration is still
necessarily done by hand, and the glaze on some fancy biscuits is
imparted by spraying the moulded biscuit with very fine jets
of fresh milk. Cracknels are made from a very stiff dough, and
when cut out are thrown into coppers of boiling water. They
speedily float to the top, remaining apart and not forming into
groups. From these coppers they are taken out in trays pierced so
as to drain off the water. Then they go into vats of cold water,
from which they are again removed, and after being strained of
their moisture are panned and baked in a fierce oven.</p>
